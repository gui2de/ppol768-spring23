Mini Bio:

My name is Alexa Coon and I am a first year in the MIDP program. I am interested in 
working, as the program name says, in international development, hopefully focusing 
on issues related to migration/refugee status and environmental sustainability. I am 
also interested in learning more about what a future in research looks like.

I am from Dayton, OH and went to my undergraduate at American University studying
international relations and Spanish Language and culture. I have some background 
with coding but only in Python. I was in the first semester STATA seminar during the 
Fall 2022 semester, so I am not completely at a loss when it comes to coding in STATA,
but I am still heavily reliant on google. I have no experience at all with any Git
related software or SurveyCTO. 


Other info 
=============
I am interested in the growing work on information collection and analysis that is has emerged in the last few years relating to human migration. More rapid human migrations continues to change at unprecedented rates due to factors like
-natural disasters
-climate change
-increased globalization
-technological increases that improve connectivity
-and ongoing political and civil conflict.

Understanding and developing better strategies in this field will help the global community handle a future with more migration, more refugees, and more internal displacement.

One organization that does work in this area is the Joint Data Center on Forced Displacement. Following the [link to the webpage] https://www.jointdatacenter.org/what-we-do/ here you can see the four steps that the JDC use to breakdown issues of forced displacement for study.
