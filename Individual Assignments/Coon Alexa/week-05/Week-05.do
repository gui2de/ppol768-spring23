/*Q3.
We have the GPS coordinates for 111 households from a particular village. You are a field manager and your job is to assign these households to 19 enumerators (~6 surveys per enumerator per day) in such a way that each enumerator is assigned 6 households that are close to each other. Manually assigning them for each village will take you a lot of time. Your job is to write an algorithm that would auto assign each household (i.e. add a column and assign it a value 1-19 which can be used as enumerator ID). Note: Your code should still work if I run it on data from another village.*/

use q3_GPS_Data.dta
//19 enumerators and 6 surveys/day
gen enum_number=0
order latitude longitude enum_number id age female
//replace enum_number=(1/19) //tried to make a series of 1-19 but failed

//gsort latitude //confirm that gsort puts all lats and longs together when they are moved
//puts all close latitudes together, but how to ensure longitudes are also close...
/*
to do this I would 
load dataset
set up a tempfile to store the groups in then
set up a loop to 
	first identify the closest 6 households by lat and long// not just one or the other because this could mean you have a slice that is close by latitude but not by longitude and vice versa 
	by cluster
	gen a group_#
	I would move those into the group
	gen numberator_#
	I would assign a numerator to that group 
	I would send the numbers in this group to the tempfile
	I would remove these data points from the data set
	I would end the loop
	I would merge the dataset without the grouped data points //this is so the next loop that runs does not include the points that have already been put in a group
	Allow the loop to run until all data points have been grouped and assigned to a numerator

//need to block together various groups and then remerge them to the list to remove them from the next set of selections, so that each group of 6 is unique and as close as possible 
//make a loop that groups the closest 6
//merge the data found in that loop to the data that is not categorized so that it is not reassigned
