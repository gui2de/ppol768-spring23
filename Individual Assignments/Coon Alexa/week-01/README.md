Mini Bio:

My name is Alexa Coon and I am a first year in the MIDP program. I am interested in 
working, as the program name says, in international development, hopefully focusing 
on issues related to migration/refugee status and environmental sustainability. I am 
also interested in learning more about what a future in research looks like.

I am from Dayton, OH and went to my undergraduate at American University studying
international relations and Spanish Language and culture. I have some background 
with coding but only in Python. I was in the first semester STATA seminar during the 
Fall 2022 semester, so I am not completely at a loss when it comes to coding in STATA,
but I am still heavily reliant on google. I have no experience at all with any Git
related software or SurveyCTO.
