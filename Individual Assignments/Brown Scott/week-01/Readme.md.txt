I bring to this class my research and advocacy experiences through internships with advocacy coalitions, think tanks, and political campaigns, which have centered on US economic development and immigration policy. I am currently a Policy Fellow with the National Association of Development Organizations (NADO), where I support advocacy and research activities related to federal economic development policy. At the same time, I work as a research assistant for a public-private partnership consulting firm. These experiences build on my undergraduate studies in sociology and political science at Lafayette College. I will earn a Master of Public Policy from Georgetown University in May 2023.

In addition to taking graduate-level coursework in quantitative research methods, I have used Stata through internships/fellowships to analyze federal data sets, produce descriptive statistics and data visualizations for fact sheets and research publications. I have taken some online coursework in R and GitHub but havenâ€™t had opportunities to regularly practice these skills. I have also used Qualtrics for a survey study during my undergraduate career and hope to gain proficiency in SurveyCTO.
