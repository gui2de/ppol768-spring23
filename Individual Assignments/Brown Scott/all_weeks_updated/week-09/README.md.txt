Part 1's code generates data with a treatment variable and treatment effect with strata groups and continuous covariates. The dataset also includes controls to de-bias estimates. The loop collects regression results at different sample sizes and generate histograms.

With larger sample sizes, the regression models become more powerful; the distribution of estimates become narrow and centered around the true effect. The simulation also illustrates how changing the strength of the treatment effect and the degree of confounding between the treatment variable and the outcome variable. As you change these factors, you can observe how the histograms shift and the accuracy of the regression parameter estimates change.

Finally, part 1 also allows illustrates the effect of adding controls to the regression models, such as the inclusion of stratum fixed effects. Adding these controls serve to de-bias estimated effects and increase their precision.


Part 2 includes a channel and collider.

The w variable is important because it shows how colliders can bias the estimated effect of a treatment on an outcome. When W is not controlled for, the estimated effect of treatment on Y will be biased. This is because W is correlated with Y and treatment. When W is controlled for, the estimated effect of treatment on Y will be closer to the true effect.

The z variable is important because it shows how confounders can bias the estimated effect of a treatment on an outcome. When Z is not controlled for, the estimated effect of treatment on Y will be biased. This is because Z is correlated with treatment and Y. When Z is controlled for, the estimated effect of treatment on Y will be closer to the true effect.

The difference between Z and W is that Z is a confounder, while W is a collider. A confounder is a variable that is correlated with both treatment and Y. A collider is a variable that is correlated with both treatment and Y, but is caused by both treatment and Y.
