This code simulates a data-generating process (DGP) for a study on the effect of a treatment on life satisfaction, which is a function of income, age, marriage, and education. The DGP includes strata groups, continuous covariates, and random noise. The strata groups affect the outcome and have different sizes, and the probability that an individual unit receives treatment varies across strata groups. One of the covariates affects both the outcome and the likelihood of receiving treatment (a confounder), while another affects the outcome but not the treatment, and another affects the treatment but not the outcome.

The code estimates regression models with and without the treatment variable and calculates the power of these models to estimate the treatment parameter, defined as the proportion of regressions in which p<0.05 for the treatment effect. The code also finds the minimum sample size required to obtain 80% power for regression models with and without the non-biasing controls. Lastly, the code finds the minimum detectable effect size at a fixed sample size, with varying treatment effects.

The results of the simulations show that the models with the treatment variable have higher power than those without the treatment variable, indicating that the treatment variable is a significant predictor of the outcome. The minimum sample size required to obtain 80% power is higher for the model with the confounding covariate than for the model without it, suggesting that controlling for confounding variables requires a larger sample size to achieve the same level of statistical power. The minimum detectable effect size is smaller for the model with the confounding covariate than for the model without it, indicating that controlling for confounding variables can increase the sensitivity of the model to detect treatment effects. This suggests that controlling for confounding variables can improve the validity of the causal inference in the study.
