# Biography

## Overview
I am Xinyu Zheng, a second-year MPP student at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. I originally came from China and earned a bachelor's degree in Economics at Beijing Foreign Studies University. My research or policy interest is sustainable development, especially renewable energy development.

## Technical Background
* Stata: I have been learning Stata since my undergraduate and understand syntaxes for standard descriptive analysis and regression. I am coding in Stata for my thesis analyzing whether financial constraints on firms deter them from eco-innovation, known as green technologies, with World Bank Enterprise Survey. 
* Git and GitHub: I also have experience using Git, GitHub, and Git Bash, which I learned from Introduction to Data Science last spring, and I have used it for my research assistant and teaching assistant work.
* SurveyCTO: I do not have any experience in using SurveyCTO.

## Research Interest
With interest in sustainable development, I have been working on projects to answer questions about green technology, environmental justice, and renewable energy.

As suggested by Kaya equation $CO2 = {CO2 \over E} * {E \over GDP} * {GDP \over POP} * POP$, to reduce CO2 emission, feasible approaches are **reducing carbon intensity** measured by ${CO2 \over E}$ and **controlling energy intensity** measured by ${E \over GDP}$, both of which are discussed in the following projects.
