# Biography
I am Xinyu Zheng, a second-year MPP student at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. I originally came from China and earned a bachelor's degree in Economics at Beijing Foreign Studies University. My research or policy interest is sustainable development, especially renewable energy development. 

## Technical background
I have been learning Stata since my undergraduate and understand syntaxes for standard descriptive analysis and regression. I am coding in Stata for my thesis analyzing whether financial constraints on firms deter them from eco-innovation, known as green technologies, with World Bank Enterprise Survey. I also have experience using Git, GitHub, and Git Bash, which I learned from Introduction to Data Science last spring, and I have used it for my research assistant and teaching assistant work. However, I do not have any experience in using SurveyCTO.
