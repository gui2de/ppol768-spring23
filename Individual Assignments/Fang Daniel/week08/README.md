# Week08 Assignment

## Daniel Fang

## Part I
My name is Yuqing (Daniel) Fang, and I am a second year MPP student at Georgetown University. I grew up in Shenzhen, a vibrant, populous megacity located right next to the world-famous Hong Kong. I completed my undergraduate degree from Macalester College with political science and economic majors, and a minor in statistics. My policy interests are economic policies and international development policies.

##Technical Background
Having completed McCourt's prerequisites, I have experiences working on Stata, performing tasks such as data editing and analysis. I have some experience using Git and Github in statistics courses in college, but mostly for turning in assignments and managing a group project. I have not participated in a formal research experience that requires Github collaborations. I have no experience working with SurveyCTO.

##Research Interests
It is exciting to having taken the research design and implementation course because I get to be led by top researchers at professional research institutions, and have the chance of learning their skills and experiences. As an Economics major in college, I received rigorous academic trainings, and got to work on some exciting research topics on macroeconomic theories and economic developments with my peers. 

For example, one of my research projects attempted to predict a demand-deficient recession after COVID-19 hits global economy. Supply shocks affect both consumption and production but eventually have spillover disruption on demand. An example of the equation we used is the classical consumption and leisure tradeoff function: $U(C_t, l_t) = lnC_t + ln(h - N_t), where $C_t$ and $l_t$ denote the consumption and leisure at time t and h denotes total hours people have that can be spent on working and relaxing. I am also interested in other policy areas such as:
1. Technology policy
2. Housing policy
3. Healthcare policy
4. Environmental policy

Here are some resources I think would be helpful in developing a potential research topic in this class:
