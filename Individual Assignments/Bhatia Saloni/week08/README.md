## Summary of Results 

### Part 1 
\
In part 1 of the Week 8, the data generating process (DGP) is such that the independent variable x1 is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 for a fixed number of 10000 observations. The dependent variable y = 3*x + 1 + rnormal(). After regressing y on x, the simulate command has been used to generate random samples to be tested. This has been done for N = 10,100,1000,10000. As seen in the graphs, increasing sample sizes while simulating the data 500 times reduces the variance in our regression model and the sample may be deemed closer to the population.
\
The two Figures have been saved in the output folder - Graph1.png and Graph2.png. The Table showing variation in beta estimates can also be found in the outputs folder called output_part1.txt.

### Part2
\
In part 1 of the Week 8, the data generating process (DGP) is such that the independent variable x is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 for a fixed number of 10000 observations. The dependent variable y = 10*x + 5 + rnormal(). After regressing y on x, the simulate command has been used to generate random samples to be tested. This has been done for N = 2, 4, 10,100,1000,10000. As seen in the graphs, increasing sample sizes while simulating the data 500 times reduces the variance in our regression model and the sample may be deemed closer to the population.
\
Note: While the simulation runs for all values of N, the data and graphs are not visible for all N=2^21.

The two Figures have been saved in the output folder - Graph3.png and Graph4.png. The Table showing variation in beta estimates can also be found in the outputs folder called output_part2.txt.
