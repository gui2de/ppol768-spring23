1.6: The width of the confidence interval decreases as the sample size increases. The SEM also increases as sample size increases, which is a function of the data generation process including an error source and would not normally be observed.

2.4: The width of the confidence interval decreases as the sample size increases. The SEM also increases as sample size increases, which is a function of the data generation process including an error source and would not normally be observed. 

2.5: Unclear about what this is asking for. To my understanding, I was able to draw a larger sample size because I specified a larger sample size in my code. I used the same data generating process for both parts because that was what the instructions appeared to specify, or at least allow for. A comparison table would show nothing of interest given these conditions. 

2.6: Changing repetitions from 500 did not change anything.
