--------------------

1. Introduction
 I'm a 2nd year MPP student. I began to learn STATA through my quant classes in McCourt. I could do basic explanatory data analysis with STATA.  In my Quant 2 class, I could perform paper replication with STATA. 

 I touched a little on GitHub through Intro to DS class but I am not very skilled at using the branch and merge tools via GitHub in group project. I haven't heard or learn anything about SurveyCTO before.

3. Research Interest

Currently I'm doing a Capstone project for an education NGO, [the Varkey Foundation](https://www.varkeyfoundation.org/ "the Varkey Foundation") to deliver character education to Latin American kids. I'm also interested in studying education equality for migrant workers's children in China.
