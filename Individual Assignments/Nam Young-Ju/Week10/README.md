# Young-Ju Nam (Week_10)


Part 1. 
===================

![Power](img/Power_table.png)

So far, I have developed some DGP including "strata groups", "continuos covariates", and "random noise" as well as "confounder". After constructing unbiased and biased regression model, I could estimate the treatment parameter and run regressions at various sample sizes.

From the results, I could find that unbiased model has better power, showing smaller sample sizes raised higher than 0.8 earlier than biased model. This shows that unbiased model has a more precised equation to estimate outcome. 

However, I've failed the find "minimum sample size", and "minimum detectable effect size"


Part 2.
===================

Since I got stucked at Part 1, I couldn't get Part 2. Instead, I did week 13 assignment.
