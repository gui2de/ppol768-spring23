# Young-Ju Nam
A two-paragraph biography

My name is Young-ju Nam, and I’m from South Korea. I am a first year MIDP student now. Before I came to the Georgetown University, I have been working at the Export-Import Bank of Korea for 10 years. I was in charge of providing financial support to overseas infrastructure projects such as power plants, water supply, hospitals, and railways to help Korean exporting companies expand their overseas business. To deepen my academic background and acquire rigorous quantitative analytical skills, I would devote myself to learn various programs during 2 years of MIDP. After graduation, I hope to be an ODA expert to make a better world.

Even though I’ve working for 10 year, I’ve never experience with STATA, GitHub, or SurveryCTO before. Since I started learn STATA from last semester, I can say I’m absolutely new to those filed regarding research tools. However, I really wish to improve my skillsets to the extent which I can easily handle research data while working. In this regard, this course will be meaningful and fruitful, despite of its challenging workloads.
