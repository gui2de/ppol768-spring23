# Young-Ju Nam (Week_08)


Part 1. 
===================

The more samples we have, the more 'beta' centered towards.
This gives us an idea that more samples make more precise value for 'beta'.

The more samples we have, the more 'sem' close to 0.
This gives us an idea that more samples reduce standard errors.

The more samples we have, the more 'range' close to 0.
This gives us an idea that more samples raise confidentiality of the prediction.

Part 2.
===================

The more samples we have, the more 'beta' centered towards.
This gives us an idea that more samples make more precise value for 'beta'.

Since the population size was not fixed unlike Part.1, we could draw larger sample size, and it give more clear comparisons among differene samples. 

When I increase the number of repetitions from 500, it showed more centered distribution shapes.
