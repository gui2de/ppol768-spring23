* Feedbacks from Week_07
You can add constraints to responses, like email
=> Done

Can you find a way to turn your work_experience module in a repeat group? It would first ask how many work experiences people have, and then ask these same questions for each experience. (your method of coding works too)
=> Done

list-label only works for multiple questions that share the same scale (and present them in a table). In you case, you only need field-list to make all questions appear on the same screen
=> Done

Have a great day~!
