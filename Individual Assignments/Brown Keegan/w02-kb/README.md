BIO
====================

I am a second year MPP student with interests in labor, income inequality, monetary policy, 
and machine learning applications. I have strong experiece in Stata, but limited experience 
in GitHub and SurveyCTO. I also have expeience with Python and R. My thesis is currently 
exploring inflation inequality impacts on social services. 

I am from Des Moines, Iowa, and looking to do a career transition form comms related work 
to more specific DS roles. I moved to Utah for my undergrad degree, and found my favorite
place on earth - Big Cottonwood Canyon. See relative path (/img/) for details.  


Research Interests 
===================

1. Labor policy (e.g. benefits policy, wage policy, workforce development, etc)
2. Income inequality (particularly related to pricing, relative poverty, and the <br /> of influence financial markets)
3. Monetary policy (particularly open market operations and price levels/ inflation)
4. Machine learning/ advanced econometric applications for big data

>Expanding on the research interests listed above, I have a few years of background in financial services on the institutional side. This has spurred interest in financial markets and how they function relative to broader economic conditions. 

>On the data science side, and area that I am interested in is examining transaction level data for a nationally representitive sample, and use this to examine the impacts of inflation on different populations. This work is being done in some iterations through opportuntiy insights currently, but CE data and other publiclly available datasets fall short for a variety of reasons.
