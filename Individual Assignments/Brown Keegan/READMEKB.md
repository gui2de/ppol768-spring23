Keegan Brown
PPOL768

I am a second year grad student within the MPP program, interested in economic research relating to inequality, housing, and inflation. My background is primarially in communications work, with an emphasis on crisis support and political communications. 

I am relatively familiar with the basics of python, R, and STATA, but most proficient with R. I have very little experience with github, but have frequently worked to troubleshoot complex code independently. I have not used SurveyCTO.
