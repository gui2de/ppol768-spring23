Part 1: Sample noise in a fixed population

The results of running the program 500 times for each sample size allows to see how the data distribution narrows as we increase the sample size. As we obtain an increasingly larger sample size, we are more likely to get the true population mean. In addition, both the standard error and the range of the confidence intervals become increasingly smaller as we increase the sample size.
