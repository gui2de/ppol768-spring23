Research Design and Implementation
I am a Master of Public Policy Candidate at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy. During my first year, I served as the Vicepresident of the Georgetown Technology Policy Initiative, a student-led organization fostering community and debate to better understand the intersection between policy and technology. I had the opportunity to do a summer internship at the World Bank, where I supported the Digital Development Global Practice division. While I have had the opportunity to learn basic Stata skills during my master’s degree, I have no experience working with GitHub and SurveyCTO.

Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as Program Manager at Accountability Lab Mexico, one of the leading non-profit organizations in the fight against corruption around the world. At the same time, he served as the National Director of the Mexican Network for Public Service, where we shaped a new generation of young public servants committed to positively transform government institutions. In addition, I previously collaborated with the Permanent Mission of Mexico to the United Nations and Fundación IDEA, one of the first public policy think tanks in Mexico. I am a member of Generation Democracy's Global Advisory Board and a World Economic Forum’s Global Shaper.
