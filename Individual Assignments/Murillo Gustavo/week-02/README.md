Research Design and Implementation

Gustavo's Bio
=============

Academic Background
-------------
I am a Master of Public Policy Candidate at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy. During my first year, I served as the Vicepresident of the Georgetown Technology Policy Initiative, a student-led organization fostering community and debate to better understand the intersection between policy and technology. I had the opportunity to do a summer internship at the World Bank, where I supported the Digital Development Global Practice division. While I have had the opportunity to learn basic Stata skills during my master’s degree, I have no experience working with *GitHub* and *SurveyCTO*.

Work Experience
-------------
Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as Program Manager at Accountability Lab Mexico, one of the leading non-profit organizations in the fight against corruption around the world. At the same time, he served as the National Director of the Mexican Network for Public Service, where we shaped a new generation of young public servants committed to positively transform government institutions. In addition, I previously collaborated with the Permanent Mission of Mexico to the United Nations and Fundación IDEA, one of the first public policy think tanks in Mexico. I am a member of Generation Democracy's Global Advisory Board and a World Economic Forum’s Global Shaper. 

Living Abroad
-------------
Throughout my life, I have had the opportunity to live in different cities (Table 1) which have enabled me expand horizons in many ways. First of all, I have gained new perspectives which have enabled me to develop more creative solutions to policy problems. In addition, I have learned about the importance of cultural competency when adopting global solutions to a local context, even within a seemingly homogenous country. 

Table 1. Cities Where I have Lived
| City        | Year |  Length  |
|-------------|------|----------|
| Sao Paulo   | 2014 | 8 months |
| Madrid      | 2015 | 6 months |
| New York    | 2016 | 8 months |
| Montreal    | 2017 | 6 months |

Research Interests
-------------
My research interests were shaped back in 2020 when the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit Mexico. I then found myself working with many actors that are often overlooked in policymaking, such as informal workers and indigenous people. Witnessing first-hand how many people from these vulnerable communities lost already scarce opportunities for not having internet access had a profound impact on me. Since then, I have made it my mission to help bridge the digital gap in the Latin America region. I am particularly interested in working in the following topics:

1. Digital Inclusion 
2. Cybersecurity
3. Financial Inclusion
4. Digital Transformation of SMEs
