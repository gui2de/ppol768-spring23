*Peyton Weber 2023 PPOL 768

*I am a second year MPP student with McCourt. I am particularly interested in environmental policy and sustainbility. Within environmental policy, I am especially concerned about methane emissions that are released once food waste reaches landfills. This year, I am conducting my thesis on food policy councils and food waste on a county level in the United States.

*As a second-year student, I have been able to take both Stata recitation courses. I am also familiar with Stata from my regressions course. I do not have any previous experience with GitHub or SurveyCTO. I have also never previously taken a research design or computer science course. I look forward to taking the course and becoming more confident in my coding and general computer skills.
