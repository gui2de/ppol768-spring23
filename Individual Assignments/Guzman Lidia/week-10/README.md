Week 10

Part 1:

Figures and table results:

![sample sizes and minimum detectable effects](img/power_ss.png "Sample sizes and minimum detectable effects")

![Sample sizes for 80 percent power](img/graph.png "Sample sizes for 80 percent power")

From this table and graph we can interpret that the "minimum sample size" required to obtain 80% power for regression models is between N = 1000 (mean .792) and N = 1200 (mean .856). 

![Estimated sample size to tests](img/test_ss.png "Estimated sample size to tests")

From this table we can see from the fixed sample sizes, how they can be split in treatment and control groups to carry the  p<0.05 for the treatment effect and 80% power for the regression models.
