Hello, My name is Lidia Guzmán Fernández, I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain, but left at the age of sixteen to study in the UK until the age of twenty-one. For the next three years I lived and worked in the fashion industry in Barcelona, Spain, and the following three years in Paris, France. In August 2021 I arrived in DC. Here I am a second year MPP student.

My level of experience with Stata, GitHub, and SurveyCTO is minimal and extremely close to zero. Prior to this MPP I had never used Stata nor Github, what I know is what I have been taught at the school. I had a two-day SurveyCTO training but never used it professionally.
