TEST: TOO LONG FIELD LABEL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

These stata labels are longer then 80 characters which means that Stata will cut them off. The 
point of having a Stata label variable is to manually make sure that the labels documenting the 
variables in the data set makes sense to a human reader. The following labels should be shortened:

",""row"" ,""type"" ,""name"" ,""labellength"" ,""labelstata"" "
",""35"",""select_one"",""country_satisfaction"",""122"",""How would you rate your overall experience in {university_country_label} during your time studying at {university_name}?"""
