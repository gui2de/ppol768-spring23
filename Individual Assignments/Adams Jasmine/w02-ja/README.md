# **About me...**
*Jasmine Adams* <br />
*PPOL 768*

I am a second-year Master of Public Policy student at [Georgetown University](http://georgetown.edu/) (â€™23) originally from the D.C. area/Palm Beach Gardens, FL. I am enrolled in a course on Research Design and Implementation that will primarily focus on strategies and best practices for gathering social science data and cleaning and analyzing the data in Stata. I have been using Stata for a few years now and was introduced to GitHub and R this past year through the Google Data Analytics course and an introductory Data Science course at GU. Iâ€™ve also been exposed to basic SQL and HTML through prior professional experience and working in RMarkdown.

I am interested in conducting interdisciplinary social science research after graduation. I gained experienced doing M&E work in the international development through an internship at a start-up in Washington, D.C. last summer (2022) and am currently a Senior Research Assistant at YES Research Lab (McDonough School of Business) which focuses on research in Organizational Behavior. In both roles, I've gathered/analyzed primary survey data using the Qualtrics survey platform.
