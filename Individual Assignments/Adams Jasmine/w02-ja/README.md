*PPOL 768*

I am a second-year Master of Public Policy student at Georgetown University (’23) originally from the D.C. area/Palm Beach Gardens, FL. I am enrolled in a course on Research Design and Implementation that will primarily focus on strategies and best practices for gathering social science data and cleaning and analyzing the data in Stata. I have been using Stata for a few years now and was introduced to GitHub and R this past year through the Google Data Analytics course and an introductory Data Science course at GU. I’ve also been exposed to basic SQL and HTML through prior professional experience and working in RMarkdown.

I am interested in conducting interdisciplinary social science research following graduation. I gained experienced doing M&E work in the international development through an internship at a start-up in Washington, D.C. last summer (2022) and am currently a Senior Research Assistant at YES Research Lab (McDonough School of Business) which focuses on research in Organizational Behavior. In both roles, I've gathered/analyzed primary survey data using the Qualtrics survey platform.
