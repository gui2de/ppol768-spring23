# Diana Rivas Garcia Week 13 Assignment 

This survey was initially created to help with my team project. I have made edits to it based on the feedback comments: 

1. I skip the rest of the survey as soon as an eligibility question disqualifies someone. I also added a note thanking the person and letting them know they cannot be part of the program but I appreciate their time. 

2. I added constraints to the name to be letters and phone to be integers. 

3. I asked the gender question as part of the eligibility criteria instead of keeping it later in the survey. If the person being surveyed is male they will get the note letting them know they are disqualified and the survey will skip to the end. 

4. I framed the questions "how many hours per week..." To "how many hours last week..."

5. I took time_constraints out of the time group so that it would appear based on the relevance of the previous question. 

I did not follow one of the suggestions to make the "where are you originally from?" a select_one type question - I do not think this is appropriate because the objective of this question is to observe internal migration and if there are any migrants from other countries. For example, some people might originally be from Venezuela and this can be better captured with a text type question. 

Once I ran ietestform on the survey I made all the edits suggested such as getting rid of trailing spaces in the choices and making some questions required and adding a label:stata column.
