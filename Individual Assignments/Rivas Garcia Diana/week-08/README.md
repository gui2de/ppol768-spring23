With this graph we can see the center limit theorem being represented the larger the N is. The larger the N, the more normally distributed the estimates for beta are. The small variation for beta estimates when N=10 shows that a larger N gets us more accurate data. As N grows the se and ci should be getting smaller because we are able to get more accurate results representative of the population.
