Assignment Week 01a

My name is Diana Rivas and I am a first year in the Master's of International Development Program at McCourt. I have a bachelor's in joint international relations and economics from Lehigh University. I am originally from Michoacan, Mexico but I have lived in Portland, Oregon for most of my life. Before starting my graduate program I gained professional experience in banking and finance. Last year I was awarded a Fulbright Grant and I moved to Mexico for 9 months to teach English and conduct a qualitative research project about the informal economy in my placement city. 

Prior to starting my studies, I had not been exposed to research softwares so my knowledge in this area is very limited. Last semester I began learning how to use STATA and completed my course's problem sets and projects successfully with it. Because my experience is so limited, I am challenging myself by taking this course and I am eager to learn.
