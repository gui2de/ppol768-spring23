Assignment Week 01a

My name is Diana Rivas and I am a first year in the Master's of International Development Program at McCourt. I have a bachelor's in joint international relations and economics from Lehigh University. I am originally from Michoacan, Mexico but I have lived in Portland, Oregon for most of my life. Before starting my graduate program I gained professional experience in banking and finance. Last year, I was awarded a Fulbright Grant and I moved to Mexico for 9 months to teach English and conduct a qualitative research project about the informal economy in my placement city. 

Prior to starting my studies, I had not been exposed to research softwares, so my knowledge in this area is very limited. Last semester I began learning how to use STATA and completed my courses' problem sets and projects successfully with it. Because my experience is so limited, I am challenging myself by taking this course and I am eager to learn.  

My main research interests are financial inclusion and entrepreneurship in developing countries. Being part of the MIDP program has helped me design my classes by giving me the opportunity to do projects in these topics that I am interested in. Below is a table with more information about what makes the aforementioned topics interesting to me.

| Topic                    |  Policy Applications         | Why am I interested in this?                                                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Financial Inclusion      | Creating tools for the poor  | I studied economy in undergrad and I am interested in formal vs informal sectors|
| Entrepreneurship         | Promoting economic activity  | My family is full of entrepreneurs so I love studying this subject              |
