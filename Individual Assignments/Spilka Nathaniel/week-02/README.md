## Bio and Research Interests

My name is Nate Spilka and I'm a second year MPP student. I'm interested in domestic policy research concerning early life interventions (e.g., TANF, CTC, youth/community centers). I'm studying the effect of [youth and community development centers in NYC](https://www.nyc.gov/site/dycd/index.page) on neighborhood juvenile crime for my thesis. Below is a table of some annual NYPD complaint crime data in 1990, 2001, and 2022. [Here's](https://compstat.nypdonline.org/2e5c3f4b-85c1-4635-83c6-22b27fe7c75c/view/89) an interactive map if you're interested.

## Background

My background prior to McCourt is largely in neuroscience/psychology research (here's research about [alcohol](https://www-nature-com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/articles/s41467-022-28735-5) and [music psychology](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210066)), which informed my interest in applications of behavioral economics in policy.

I have experience using Stata, Github, Git, R, Matlab, and Bash, but have never used SurveyCTO. I'm looking forward to using more Stata and learning SurveyCTO this semester! In my free time I enjoy cooking, training jiu jitsu, swimming, and playing guitar.

Here is my favorite place (and favorite people) ![favorite place](/img/pic.HEIC)

I love the MSE!

$$ MSE = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i})^{2}}{n} $$
