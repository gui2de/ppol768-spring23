My name is Nate Spilka and I’m a second year MPP student. I’m interested in domestic policy research concerning early life interventions (e.g., TANF, CTC, youth/community centers). For my thesis, I’m studying the effect of youth and community development centers in NYC on neighborhood juvenile crime. My background prior to McCourt is largely in neuroscience/psychology research (here’s a pub about [alcohol](https://www-nature-com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/articles/s41467-022-28735-5) and another about [music psychology](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210066)), which informed my interest in applications of behavioral economics in policy.

I have experience using Stata, Github, Git, and Bash, but have never used SurveyCTO. I’m looking forward to using more Stata and learning SurveyCTO this semester! In my free time I enjoy cooking, training jiu jitsu, and playing guitar.
