Below is a figure of the beta coefficients when the sample sizes used are 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000. We see the betas collapse around the "true" beta as the sample size increases.

The table below shows the beta coefficients and their respective standard errors, upper and lower CI bounds, as well as the CI intervals, when the sample sizes used are 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000. Again, we see that while the beta coefficients remain relatively constant, the SEs and CIs narrow (as the sample size increases).

Below is a figure of the beta coefficients when the sample sizes range from 4 to 2,097,152. Similar to the results above, we see the betas collapse around the "true" beta as the sample size increases.

The table below shows the beta coefficients and their respective standard errors, upper and lower CI bounds, as well as the CI interval, when the sample sizes used are 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000. Again, we see that while the beta coefficient remains relatively constant, the SE and CI narrows.

(5) We are able to draw from a larger sample size compared to the first part since we are using populations greater than 10,000. However, we see that the SEs and CIs are smaller in part 1 compared to those in part 2. 

(6) The distribution of betas remain relatively consistent as the number of repetitions changes (e.g., 100 vs 500). The major difference is the smoothness of the histogram which is determined by the number of samples - as the sample increases, the histogram becomes smoother (e.g., the spread is more evenly distributed at a higher number of observations compared to a smaller number of observations).
