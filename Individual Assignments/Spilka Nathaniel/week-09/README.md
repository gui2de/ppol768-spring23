### Assignment 9

This assignment was focused on understanding bias in parameter estimates when accounting for confounding variables. Specifically, when applying the assignment to the framework of my final project, this assignment would allow me to see how different confounding variables (e.g., steps) would impact an outcome measure (e.g., bmi). I include other relevant variables such as the number of hours slept, a healthy-eating index, treatment and control conditions, and differences by campus.  

In the interest of time, I commented my prediction of the output since I kept running into an error. Had I not run into the error, I anticipate that the betas would collapse round the true value as the sample size increases.
