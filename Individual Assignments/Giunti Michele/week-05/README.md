## Some Comments:

- `Q1 : Tanzania Student Data`

The loops were executed but I can't avoid the dofile breaking loop.

- `Q2 : CÃ´te d'Ivoire Population Density`

The merging and cleaning went surprisingly well so I am only waiting for a review.

- `Q3 : Enumerator Assignment based on GPS`

Am I supposed to merge the new data table to the original dataset? As far as I know, I've created the supposed Enumerators.

- `Q4 : 2010 Tanzania Election Data cleaning`

This actually went well so I have no direct comment.

- `Q5 : Tanzania Election data Merging`

Not sure I did what I was supposed to do here, please check if the output is what was intended.
