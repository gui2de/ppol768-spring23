# Week 07 - Survey CTO Assignment

The link to the survey google sheet can be found here: [Survey Sheet Michele Giunti](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ge2T-LTPc3JfW4PLyY-P_V5J61pxVxhdjogubiHslmQ/edit?usp=sharing)

The link to the form can be found here: [SurveyCTO Political Participation Form](https://gui2de.surveycto.com/collect/michele_giunti_week07_form?caseid=)

The Survey is supposed to be a baseline of political interests in the US. Fake being a US citizen if the questions asks you to, as I've coded the survey to end if you say no. Also, please try to go back and forth between questions to test out the constraints I put in.
