The assignment for biography
I'm from Chengdu, China, and I graduated from Sichuan University with a Bachelor of Arts in Labor and Social Security. With a strong desire to blend my background in labor economics with my passion for creating massive, beneficial paradigm shifts to address inequality and poverty, I choose to pursue my graduate study in MPP at Georgetown University.  

Previously, I worked as a program associate and qualitative research assistant. During the summer of 2022, I worked as a Program Coordinator in the ARCHES program at the Georgetown University School of Medicine. During the fall of 2022, I worked as a research intern with the National Center on Sex Exploitation, assisting with qualitative research related to sex exploitation reduction. Currently, I'm working on a capstone project on FWA (fraud, waste, and abuse) in Medicare using statistic software R. We intend to build a model which could examine the correlation between FWA and health outcome disparities in Medicare and detect the amplifying effects of FWA on minority populations. I have experience working with GitHub and R (in the Intro to Data Science course) and have a basic knowledge of using STATA to for quantitative analysis.
