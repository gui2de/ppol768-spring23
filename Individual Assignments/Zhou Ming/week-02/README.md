# Assignment01-The assignment for biography
I'm from Chengdu, China, and I graduated from Sichuan University with a Bachelor of Arts in Labor and Social Security. With a strong desire to blend my background in labor economics with my passion for creating massive, beneficial paradigm shifts to address inequality and poverty, I choose to pursue my graduate study in MPP at Georgetown University.

Previously, I worked as a program associate and qualitative research assistant. During the summer of 2022, I worked as a Program Coordinator in the ARCHES program at the Georgetown University School of Medicine. During the fall of 2022, I worked as a research intern with the National Center on Sex Exploitation, assisting with qualitative research related to sex exploitation reduction. Currently, I'm working on a capstone project on FWA (fraud, waste, and abuse) in Medicare using statistic software R. We intend to build a model which could examine the correlation between FWA and health outcome disparities in Medicare and detect the amplifying effects of FWA on minority populations. I have experience working with GitHub and R (in the Intro to Data Science course) and have a basic knowledge of using STATA to for quantitative analysis.

# Assignment02- Research Interest
Due to my study in labor economics during my undergraduate and my recent exposure to the field in coursework, i'm particularly interested in the drivers of labor force participation (LFP) rate .

## Understanding the Labor Force Participation Rate
The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the civilian non-institutional population 16 years and older that is working or actively looking for work. It indicates the relative amount of labor resources available for the production of goods and services.

$$ labor participation rate = {(Labor Force) \over (Civilian Noninstitutional Population)}100 $$

It is an important labor market indicator since it could have a huge impact on the overall economy and provide information about the overall health of the labor market. For example, a decline in the number of people participating in the labor force could have a negative impact on the overall economy. According to research published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia in 2017 [1], a falling LFP rate can slow the growth of GDP, as fewer people are contributing to the production of goods and services. Additionally, a lower participation rate could lead to higher tax rates, as it would result in a narrower tax base.

## Trends in Labor Force Participation Rate
Since 2007, the labor force participation rate has fallen from about 66 percent to about 62.3 percent (December 2022) in the U.S.. A falling participation rate means more people are simply unable or unwilling to work at current wages. The effects of non-participation on society are potentially severe: slower economic growth and a rising dependency ratio.

| Year     | Labor Force Participation Rate |
| :---     |             :----:             |  
| Dec 2022 |     62.3                       |
| Dec 2021 |     62.0                       |
| Dec 2020 |     61.5                       |
| Dec 2019 |     63.3                       |
| Dec 2018 |     63.0                       |
| Dec 2017 |     62.7                       |

## Factors contributing to low Labor Force Participation Rate
The sources of this decline have been widely debated among academics and policymakers, as listed below.
* Economic factors, such as business cycle
* Structural changes, such as the aging of the population
* Social factors

## Research Interest
My research interest lies in exploring the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on labor force participation rate across gender. On the one hand, the strict lockdown severely affected specific industries, including travel and retail, with lower wages, where a large proportion of employed workers were female. The difficulty in finding jobs could force these women quit labor force. On the other hand, increased caregiving and discrimination in the labor market contributed to fewer women entering the workforce or holding full-time employment during scarcities of work. It also indicates the heterogeneous effects on women with different demographic characteristics (e.g., education level, marital status, the number of children, etc.). Research in this field could provide policy implications for designing cost-effective policies and decreasing long-lasting negative impacts on relative labor market outcomes of women.
