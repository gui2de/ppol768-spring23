# Week 13: Transportation Survey updates

I've incorporated feedback from week 7 to address errors and make the form more readable. I've also added a duplicate check, a sensitive list experiment and used the ietestform command to flag and fix potential issues with the form (see the .do file)

My survey form can be found here: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNZyK4QUjAsBO4SvZbS2u7a3atVxqzR329oPfFsl0DE/edit?usp=sharing)

The survey itself can be found here: [here](https://gui2de.surveycto.com/collect/cmg_wk07_survey?caseid=)
