# BIO

### Intro

My name is Emma Nyhof and I am in my second year of the MPP program as an evening student. I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, but grew up in Michigan. I moved to Washington, DC shortly after graduating from college, and have now lived in area for almost 5 years. I am currently a policy analyst at the Center on Education and the Workforce here at Georgetown, and previously I have worked as a research assistant at American Institutes for Research and the Congressional Research Service. Most of my work has focused on education and labor policy.

I have quite a bit of experience with Stata, starting in my undergraduate economics program, and have worked with it extensively in each of my jobs since. In my current role I regularly use Stata to clean and analyze large public datasets, and in previous a role I have worked with data from smaller intervention-based surveys. I currently have no experience with GitHub or SurveyCTO, so I'm looking forward to gaining experience in these areas during this class.

### Research Interests

My research interests are related to education and labor policy, including topics such as:
* Education finance (both K-12 and higher ed) 
* College and career readiness
* College affordability
* Student debt
* Workforce development

Overall, I am interested in how education and workforce development can be used to work towards equitable opportunity for all. According to a study by the [Center on Education and the Workforce](https://cewgeorgetown.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/chase-uncertain_pathway_1-fr.pdf), educational attainment, particularly a bachelor's degree, is increasingly important for obtaining a good job (defined by earnings).

|Educational attainment           |Share of workers with a good job at age 30 | 
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|Less than high school            |20%                                        |
|High school diploma              |38%                                        |   
|Some college/associate's degree  |46%                                        |
|Bachelor's degree or higher      |75%                                        |

Unfortunately, the rising costs of college have made attaining a postsecondary degree more difficult, if not impossible, for many. I am interested in exploring policy options that increase access to higher education for those that want it, but also increase high quality job opportunities for those that don't want to go back to school.
