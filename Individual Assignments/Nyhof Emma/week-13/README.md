Note about the ietestform output: Was given a suggestion about "non-numeric name values" which I disregarded. It was referring to the value for the question that asks about occupation. I assume it was referring to the fact that I was using the variable name for the values in the occupations dataset as the values in the dataset are actually numeric. Also, it asked that I included Stata labels, which I did in the revised iteration. When I tested the survey again it notified me that some of the labels were too long for Stata, but I left them as is because I figured that user readability was more important than Stata readability and that the researcher would still have access to the full label anyway.
