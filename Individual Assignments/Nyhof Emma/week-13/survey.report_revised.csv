TEST: TOO LONG FIELD LABEL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

"These stata labels are longer then 80 characters which means that Stata will cut them off. The "
"point of having a Stata label variable is to manually make sure that the labels documenting the "
"variables in the data set makes sense to a human reader. The following labels should be shortened:"

,"row" ,"type" ,"name" ,"labellength" ,"labelstata" 
,"24","text","person_relationship_other","81","If you selected other, please give your relationship with {person_name} below?"
,"31","select_one","full_part_time","106","Does {person_name} work full-time (40 or more hours per week) or part-time (less than 40 hours per week)?"
,"35","select_one","wage_check","183","You selected that {person_name} works full-time, but based on the reported annual earnings it appears this person makes less than the U.S. minimum wage. Are you sure this is correct?"
,"41","integer","list_exp_control","224","How many of the following statements are true for you?- I think I deserve to make more money- I enjoy my job- I don't feel that there is room for growth in my career- I worry about covering all of my expenses each month"
,"42","integer","list_exp_treatment","277","How many of the following statements are true for you? - I think I deserve to make more money - I enjoy my job - I don't feel that there is room for growth in my career - I worry about covering all of my expenses each month - I don't always report all my income to the IRS"
