Research Interest
=================

I am interest in equal and social justice. In terms of policy ares, this would be distributive policy(including taxation and welfare) I have no research experience before, so it is a mere interest for the moment.


I have developed interest in this area through previous study of political philosophy as I was majored in philosophy at undergrad. Here is a table of writings that you might find useful to read if you want to explore this topic for a little bit.

| Title|Author|
|------|------------| 
| Luck and Equality| RichardArneson |
| What is equality | Ronald Dworkin |
| A Theory of Justice |John Rawls|

Richard Arneson is the only author above that has a personal website and this is the [link](http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/)

And here is a list of major different types of equality in political philosophy

1. Equality of opportunity
2. Equality of outcome
3. Equality of resources
4. Equality of opportunity for welfare
