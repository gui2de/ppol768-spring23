**Question 1 - This builds on Q4 of week 4 assignment. We downloaded the PSLE data of students of 138 schools in Arusha District in Tanzania (previously had data of only 1 school) You can build on your code from week 4 assignment to create a student level dataset for these 138 schools.

**Question 2 - We have household survey data and population density data of CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Merge departmente-level density data from the excel sheet (CIV_populationdensity.xlsx) into the household data (CIV_Section_O.dta) i.e. add population density column to the CIV_Section_0 dataset.

**We import the excel from which we want to extract department-level density data 
import excel "q2_CIV_populationdensity.xlsx", sheet("Population density") firstrow clear

**The column with department names is called NOMCIRCONSCRIPTION, out if which we filter out rows with department information 
keep if regex(NOMCIRCONSCRIPTION, "DEPARTEMENT")
sort NOMCIRCONSCRIPTION

**We create a new variable department that matches the department data from the .dta file 
gen department = NOMCIRCONSCRIPTION
replace department = subinstr(department, "DEPARTEMENT D'","",.)
replace department = subinstr(department, "DEPARTEMENT DE ","",.)
replace department = subinstr(department, "DEPARTEMENT DU ","",.)
replace department = strtrim(department)
replace department = lower(department)

**We save the cleaned file as a .dta file 
save "CIV_populationdensity.dta", replace

**We use the IV_Section_O.dta file to merge with the cleaned file and change the varaible b06_departemen to match with the department varaible in the CIV_populationdensity.dta file
use q2_CIV_Section_0, clear
decode b06_departemen, generate(department)

**After running the merge command once - there were 12,827 matched observation. We find that most of the unmatched observations are due to the varying spellings of Arrha/Arrha, which we change using the following command:  
replace department = subinstr(department, "arrha","arrah",.)

**This result matches 12,899 observations
merge m:1 department using "CIV_populationdensity.dta"

keep department DENSITEAUKM

**Question 3 - We have the GPS coordinates for 111 households from a particular village. You are a field manager and your job is to assign these households to 19 enumerators (~6 surveys per enumerator per day) in such a way that each enumerator is assigned 6 households that are close to each other. Manually assigning them for each village will take you a lot of time. Your job is to write an algorithm that would auto assign each household (i.e. add a column and assign it a value 1-19 which can be used as enumerator ID). Note: Your code should still work if I run it on data from another village.

**The code worked for enumerator 1 and 2 but not for all 111

**Question 4 - 2010 election data (Tz_election_2010_raw.xlsx) from Tanzania is not usable in its current form. You have to create a dataset in the wide form, where each row is a unique ward and votes received by each party are given in separate columns. You can check the following dta file as a template for your output: Tz_elec_template. Your objective is to clean the dataset in such a way that it resembles the format of the template dataset.

**if we see the number of wards, we only see 3113 number of wards whereas this should be 3333 - some ward names are common and are being reused. So we generate a unique_ward column

**I got stuck after this point and could not delete duplicate values and reshape long. I would like to learn how to solve for the two candidates in the same party problem. 

**Question 5 - Between 2010 and 2015, the number of wards in Tanzania went from 3,333 to 3,944. This happened by dividing existing ward into 2 (or in some cases more) new wards. You have to create a dataset where each row is a 2015 ward matched with the corresponding parent ward from 2010. It's a trivial task to match wards that weren't divided, but it's impossible to match wards that were divided without additional information. Thankfully, we had access to shapefiles from 2012 and 2017. We used ArcGIS to create a new dataset that tells us the percentage area of 2015 ward that overlaps a 2010 ward. You can use information from this dataset to match wards that were division 

**The answer to this question was done with the help of Ben. I do not completely understand the code and would like to clarify
