My name is Marlyn, and I'm a second-year MPP student at McCourt. I've used Stata in a very limited sense (i.e. regress Y X W, robust and other basic commands to browse data). I have used GitHub before but I'm new to GitKraken. I have never used SurveyCTO.

I'm originally from Chicago, which mostly explains my primary interest in social urban policy. In my past lives, I worked on criminal-immigration issues.
