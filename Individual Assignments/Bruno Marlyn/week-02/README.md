### Background in statistical software

My name is Marlyn, and I'm a second-year MPP student at McCourt. I've used Stata in a _very_ limited sense. Generally, I have only used it for the quant sequence at McCourt, and I'm just about to use it for my thesis analysis. I know basic commands to browse data; summarize data; and run regressions. I don't have that much experience using Stata to clean, transform, or visualize data though (I tend to prefer R for those parts of the process). I have used Git and GitHub before in a different class, but I'm new to GitKraken. GitKraken looks friendlier than using the command line in my Terminal, which is a bit of a relief. I have never used SurveyCTO.

### Research interests

_Midwest skies can even help romanticize allies and trash bins._

I'm originally from Chicago and eager to return post-McCourt. In the past, I worked on criminal-immigration issues in community organizing, legal, and program management settings. I'm still passionate about those topics, but I've been using my grad school experience to become better versed with the social policies at the local and state level. 

Outside of school, I'm a research assistant at the [Lab in DC](https://thelabprojects.dc.gov/ "Lab in DC") (it's a government agency). There, I've focused on projects related to:
*	behavioral health alternatives to policing, and 
*	high-impact tutoring
