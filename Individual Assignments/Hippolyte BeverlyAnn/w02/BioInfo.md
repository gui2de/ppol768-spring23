My name is BeverlyAnn Hippolyte, I am first-year International Development Policy (MIDP) Student and this isn't my first time working with coding software but it is my first
time working with GitHub, SurveyCTO, Atom and Stata. I would like to think that I have a basic understanding of Stata and that I am capable of learning so much more
and hopefully becoming a skilled data analyst which will make me a skilled policy analyst.
