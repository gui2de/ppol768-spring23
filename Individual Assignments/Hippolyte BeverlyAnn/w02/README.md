My name is BeverlyAnn Hippolyte, I am first-year International Development Policy (MIDP) Student and this isn't my first time working with coding software but it is my first time working with GitHub, SurveyCTO, Atom and Stata. I would like to think that I have a basic understanding of Stata and that I am capable of learning so much more and hopefully becoming a skilled data analyst which will make me a skilled policy analyst. I studied Banking and Finance at the Undergraduate level and graduate from the University of the West Indies, CaveHill campus situated in Barbados. Prior to my enrollment at Georgetown, I worked as a Credit Risk Analyst at the Saint Lucia Development Bank. My time at the Bank, fuelled my interest in International Development Policy. I really enjoyed working in this area because its purpose was to provided access to finance for higher risk citizens who would have very limited access to finance from commercial intermediaries.

Research Interest Areas

My research areas of interest are food, agriculture, migration and refugee policy. My interest in food and agriculture, mainly food security, food systems transformation and sustainable agri-food systems stems from food insecurity faced by my country Saint Lucia. Following supply chain issues, a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the region faced a serious food insecurity issue because of its food import dependency, an issue I think can be vastly reduced if Caribbean governments invest heavily in policies that are aimed at creating sustainable and subsistent food systems. By extension this can help reduce many of the health issues faced by the region and can improve the livelihoods of Caribbean people.

My career aspirations include working on valuable research projects aimed at improving the lives of vulnerable groups in developing regions specifically the Caribbean and Africa.
