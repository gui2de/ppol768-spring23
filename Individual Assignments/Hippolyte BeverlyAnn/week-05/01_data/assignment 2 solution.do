**** Question 2 ****

We have household survey data and population density data of CÃ´te d'Ivoire. 
Merge departmente-level density data from the excel sheet (CIV_populationdensity.xlsx) 
into the household data (CIV_Section_O.dta) i.e. add population density column to the CIV_Section_0 dataset.

***** Question 3 ********

## Q3 : Enumerator Assignment based on GPS
We have the GPS coordinates for 111 households from a particular village. 
You are a field manager and your job is to assign these households to 19 enumerators (~6 surveys per enumerator per day) 
in such a way that each enumerator is assigned 6 households that are close to each other. Manually assigning them for each village will take you a lot of time. 
Your job is to write an algorithm that would auto assign each household (i.e. add a column and assign it a value 1-19 which can be used as enumerator ID). 
Note: Your code should still work if I run it on data from another village.

***** Question 4 *******
## Q4 : 2010 Tanzania Election Data cleaning

/*2010 election data (Tz_election_2010_raw.xlsx) from Tanzania is not usable in its current form. 
You have to create a dataset in the wide form, where each row is a unique ward and votes received by each party are given in separate columns. 
You can check the following dta file as a template for your output: Tz_elec_template. 
Your objective is to clean the dataset in such a way that it resembles the format of the template dataset.
