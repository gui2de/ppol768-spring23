***** Question 3 ********

/*## Q3 : Enumerator Assignment based on GPS
We have the GPS coordinates for 111 households from a particular village. 
You are a field manager and your job is to assign these households to 19 enumerators (~6 surveys per enumerator per day) 
in such a way that each enumerator is assigned 6 households that are close to each other. Manually assigning them for each village will take you a lot of time. 
Your job is to write an algorithm that would auto assign each household (i.e. add a column and assign it a value 1-19 which can be used as enumerator ID). 
Note: Your code should still work if I run it on data from another village.
*/

clear 	

	tempfile enum 			  	// Generate tempfile to save local file '
	save `enum', replace emptyok
	
	use "$wd/q3_GPS Data.dta" 		// Load the dataset

	save `gpsdata', replace
	
	gen i =_n
	order i
	
forvalues i=1/111{
	
			use `gpsdata',clear
	
			keep in 1
		
			rename * one_*				// Rename the column variables; This will help distinguish the variables when we match, and makes matching easier 
		
			cross using "$wd/q3_GPS Data" // With this dataset we create a matrix using the command cross. 
	
			geodist one_latitude one_longitude latitude longitude, gen(distance) // Calculate the distance between
				// the first point and all points in the dataset.
					
			drop if one_id == id // Drop the first distance because it's matched with itself
			
			gen enumerator_id = one_id
			
			drop if distance == 0 
	
			keep in 1/6 // Keep the first  six shortest distances in the variable dist 
			
			append using "gpsdata"
	 
			save `gpsdata'
	}
*** I was able to do the first five houses and assign them to one enumerator but i can't seem to continue onto the next. //
// I've tried several codes but thye aren't working. I referenced the video from class. I did one and it worked so i thought it would work for the others.
*** I would also like to note that I referenced other student's code to improve on mine but this is the best I could do  


***** Question 4 *******
## Q4 : 2010 Tanzania Election Data cleaning

/*2010 election data (Tz_election_2010_raw.xlsx) from Tanzania is not usable in its current form. 
You have to create a dataset in the wide form, where each row is a unique ward and votes received by each party are given in separate columns. 
You can check the following dta file as a template for your output: Tz_elec_template. 
Your objective is to clean the dataset in such a way that it resembles the format of the template dataset.

***** Question 5 *****


/*
Between 2010 and 2015, the number of wards in Tanzania went from 3,333 to 3,944. This happened by dividing existing ward into 2 (or in some cases more) new wards. You have to create a dataset where each row is a 2015 ward matched with the corresponding parent ward from 2010. It's a trivial task to match wards that weren't divided, but it's impossible to match wards that were divided without additional information. Thankfully, we had access to shapefiles from 2012 and 2017. We used ArcGIS to create a new dataset that tells us the percentage area of 2015 ward that overlaps a 2010 ward. You can use information from this dataset to match wards that were divided.
