Background

  In the last 6 weeks there has been an uptick in gun violence in Saint Lucia, specifically a small town
  in the south of the island known as Vieux Fort. Notoriously known for having gang warfare, the recent spike in
  gun-related murders have been alarming. During my recent Spring-Break, five individuals were killed in one day in the community,
  a rate that is quite alarming for a country with a population of approximately 180,000 people.
  Given this backdrop, I formulated this survey to answer questions in relation to the above-mentioned.
