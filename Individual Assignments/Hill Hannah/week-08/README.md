## Question 2 - Sampling Noise in an Infinite Superpopulation

*Still trying to figure out why my graphs won't load due to `merge' issue.

In particular, take care to discuss the reasons why you are able to draw a larger sample size than in Part 1, and why the sizes of the SEM and confidence intervals might be different at the powers of ten than in Part 1. Can you visualize Part 1 and Part 2 together meaningfully, and create a comparison table?
Do these results change if you increase or decrease the number of repetitions (from 500)?
