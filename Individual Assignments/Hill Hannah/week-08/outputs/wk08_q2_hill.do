// A - randomly creates a dataset whose sample size is an argument to the program following your DGP from Part 1 including a true relationship and an error source


// B - performs a regression of Y on one X

// C - returns the N, beta, SEM, p-value, and confidence intervals into r()

// using 'simulate' command, run program 500 times each at sample sizes corresponding to the first 20 powers of two (ie 4,8,16, etc) as well as N = 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, and 1000000.

// load resulting dataset of 13,000 regression results into stata

// create one figure and one table showing variation in beta estimates depending on sample size and characterize the size of the SEM and confidence intervals as N gets larger
