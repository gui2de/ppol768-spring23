# `PPOL768: Research Design` at Georgetown University, Spring 2023



## Biography
*Hello there!* My name is **Hannah Hill (she/hers)** and I am currently in my last semester at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University pursuing a **Master of Public Policy**. My focus is on data analysis, tech governance, affordable housing, education, and transportation. Before coming to Georgetown, I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Peace & Conflict Studies from University of California Berkeley with a focus on gender-based violence and political transitions in the Middle East and North Africa. While waiting on the State Department's registry for Consular service in the Middle East, I worked as an advocate for survivors of gender-based violence (human trafficking, domestic violence, sexual assault) in the South Bay of California. I then worked in local policy for gender-based violence and housing in the region. Shortly after, I was offered admission into McCourt and moved to the East Coast!

Since coming to McCourt, I have taken a couple of data science courses such as `PPOL 670: Intro to Data Science in R` and `PPOL 683: Geographic Data in Program R`. *(Side note: I wish there was a way to transfer from the MPP program to the DSPP program once we get here and find out that we like coding! Alas. That is what free time is for.)* In `PPOL 670`, we were introduced to GitHub at the speed of light so I do not remember much about best practices. This is one of the reasons I am so excited for this course! To conquer my fear of GitHub and merging and pushing. Neither courses utilized Stata, however, I am familiar with it through the extent of mandatory Stata recitation at McCourt and additional methods required for my thesis investigating the impact of faculty diversity at California Community Colleges on transfer rates to four-year universities post-ban on affirmative action. I have not once used SurveyCTO, so I am excited to learn it!
