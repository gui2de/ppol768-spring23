Elena Spielmann BIO

I am Elena Spielmann, second year MPP. My level of experience with STATA is basic (everything we have learned through the program). I have zero experience with GitHub and SurveyCTO. I have basic experience with R through data visualization. I have been in the Army for over 9 years and will be going back to the Army after I graduate, hopefully with more technical skills involving coding.

My research interests include homeland security and national defense policy.
I have been married for five years and have two fur babies. I'm originally from Chicago, but have moved all over the country because of the Army.
