# Elena Spielmann Biography

I am Elena Spielmann, second year MPP. My level of experience with STATA is basic (everything we have learned through the program). I have zero experience with GitHub and SurveyCTO. I have basic experience with R through data visualization. I have been in the Army for over 9 years and will be going back to the Army after I graduate, hopefully with more technical skills involving coding.

I have been married for five years and have two fur babies. I'm originally from Chicago, but have moved all over the country because of the Army.

## Research Interests

My research interests include homeland security and national defense policy. I'm particularly focused on personnel policy within the Army. I'm writing my thesis on how military body composition standards may be a barrier to diverse recruiting.

 Something I've had interest in recently is the implementation of the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT)

 It's comprised of 6 events which are scored based on age and gender:
 1. Three-rep max Deadlift
 2. Hand-release Push Ups (2 min)
 3. Standing Power Throw
 4. Sprint Drag Carry
 5. Max. Plank
 6. 2 Mile Run

The ACFT is a hot topic in the Army because it was originally designed to be gender and age neutral with the concept that all Soldiers, regardless of job, gender and age, should be able to perform the same physical tasks.

Following an independent study by [RAND](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1825-1.html), the failure rates would cause an extremely large loss of women within the Army.

The Army decided not to implement it gender and age neutral based on the failure rates outlined below.

ACFT Pass Rate (Active Duty)
|Personnel   | Men   | Women   | Overall   |
|------------|-------|---------|-----------|
|Enlisted    |92%    |52%      |87%        |
|Officer     |96%    |72%      |92%        |

This is where I'll be working when I return to the Army. Las Cruces is a hidden _gem_. 10/10 would recommend.
