# Part 1: De-biasing a parameter estimate using controls
I am having problems getting my figures and tables and overall code to work. The code included is done to the best of my knowledge and ability. I assume that my resulting figures and tables would show the following:

Biasedness and convergence of the models as N grows: This involves comparing the regression estimates of the models at different sample sizes. Biasedness can be assessed by comparing the estimates to the true parameter value (if available). Convergence can be assessed by examining how the estimates change as sample size increases. Tables can be used to display the estimates for each model and sample size, while figures can be used to visually compare the estimates across models and sample sizes.

Mean and variance of beta for different regression models, as a function of N: This involves computing the mean and variance of the estimated coefficients (beta) for each model and sample size, and plotting them against sample size (N). The "true" parameter value can also be plotted for comparison. The figure should allow for easy comparison of the estimates across models and sample sizes, and should show how the estimates converge to the true value as sample size increases.
