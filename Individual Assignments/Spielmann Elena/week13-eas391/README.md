# Week 13 Survey CTO Submission

#Elena

My previous survey has been updated (and some-what re-vamped) to reflect the recommended changes and requirements for the assignment. It supports Group 3's  study: "The Impact of a “Well-Timed” Nudge on Individual Physical Activity and Health Outcomes Via Wearable Devices"
