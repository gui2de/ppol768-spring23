It may be due to stata settings or Mac settings, my code in do.file cannot output the report on my own stata. But it can run well on other stata. So I borrowed my roommate's stata and used the same code to complete the output of the report, which is why the report will display other people's names. From the questionnaire ID in the report, it can still be seen that the questionnaire code checked comes from myself.
