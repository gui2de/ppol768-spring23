# 1. Brief Introduction

Hi, everyone! I am Fan, a second year MPP student. I used to be a graduate of Financial Mathematics at the University of Liverpool. I have had some experience with Stata and Github in the past. For example, I have used stata to conduct research on the classical Kuznets curve, and I have uploaded the python project code for the research on the two-dimensional bin packing problem on github. Python, VBA and R are also in my arsenal of programming skills. Besides that, I'm also a part-time scriptwriter for historical strategy games. ![Bio](5111665681980_.pic.png)

I come from Weihai City, Shandong Province, China, a very livable seaside town. ![Hometown](WechatIMG616.png)

# 2. Research Interest

## hyperlink

My current research interest is the status quo of DEI in the United States and some new practices. The following is a literature on the status quo of the healthcare industry. [DEI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1530891X22005997?via%3Dihub)

## List

The list below corresponds to the three dimensions of DEI: Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.

-   Diversity
-   Equity
-   Inclusion

## Table

The table below is part of the previously linked literature, which to a certain extent illustrates the current problems of DEI in the US medical industry.

Institutional DEI Efforts/Trainings: Unconscious bias and microaggression training

| DEI Effort | Fellows | Faculty |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Yes        | 67.6%   | 85%     |
| No         | 14.8%   | 10.3%   |
| Don't know | 17.6%   | 4.7%    |

## Addtitional:Math function

This part has nothing to do with the above, because the literature and research on related issues do not involve the application of mathematical formulas. Here is just an attempt to insert a math formula.

$$
\frac{TC+TR+TN}{Total} = \frac{(7+1+2)}{15} = 0.666666667
$$
