Hi, everyone!
I am Fan, a second year MPP student. I used to be a graduate of Financial Mathematics at the University of Liverpool. I have had some experience with Stata and Github in the past. For example, I have used stata to conduct research on the classical Kuznets curve, and I have uploaded the python project code for the research on the two-dimensional bin packing problem on github.
Python, VBA and R are also in my arsenal of programming skills. Besides that, I'm also a part-time scriptwriter for historical strategy games.
