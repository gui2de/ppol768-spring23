We will use it for all class documents, assignments and peer reviews purposes. Here is how it is organized

1. `Class Materials` contains, for each week, readings, slides (if relevant), and assignment prompts
2. `Group Projects` contains, for each group, your group assignments submissions
2. `Individual Assignments` contains, for each student, your individual assignments submissions

You will use Pull Requests to submit your work, review your peers', and receive feedback. Feel free to create Issues to start discussions within your teams, with your peers, and with your instructors as well!
