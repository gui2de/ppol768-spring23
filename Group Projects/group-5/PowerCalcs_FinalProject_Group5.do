*Find MSS (Minimum Sample Size) required for 80% power 
power twoproportions 0.01 0.11, m1(15) m2(15) // What is the minimum required sample size - given 80% power, cluster size m1, m2 (i.e. 10 treatment villages, 10 control villages), 1% transition probability in control, and 21% transition probability in treatment, i.e. 20 percentage point increase in transition probability due to program? 

*k1 = control, # of villages 
*k2 = treatment, # of villages 

*m1 = control, # of HH's per cluster (village) 
*m2 = treatment, # of HH's per cluster (village)

*Find MDE (Minimum Detectable Effect), 
power twoproportions 0.01, k1(50) k2(50) m1(15) m2(15) power(0.80)
