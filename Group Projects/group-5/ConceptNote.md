# Manual Scavenging in India: A Skills Training and Employment Services Approach [2ND DRAFT] 

PPOL 768: Saloni Bhatia, Alexa Coon, Serenity Fan 

## Introduction

Manual scavenging involves the human collection and disposal of human excreta from dry latrines, railway tracks, septic tanks, sewer/drainage systems, and other sources without access to personal protective equipment, adequate social protection nor government support. The practice of manual scavenging is deeply entrenched in the caste system in India. Negative implications of this practice include social stigma associated with communities forced to perform “dirty work”, health implications of coming in direct contact with human waste, economic implications of earning the bare minimum for survival needs, and the human rights implications of undignified work conditions and societal marginalization. In essence, the problem of manual scavenging in India is a major governance and market failure to improve sanitation in the country, given years of continual failed interventions, promises, and stasis.\ 

Over the years, many schemes and initiatives have been undertaken that should have improved the situation and made India open defecation free. However, the functioning, utility and behavior change that need to occur alongside proposed government interventions have gone unchecked and unreported. Consequently, generations of manual scavengers continue the forced labor of cleaning excreta in sewers despite several technological and scientific advancements that should have made manual scavenging less labor-intensive.\

## Motivation
<br/>
During the pandemic, the government imposed nationwide lockdowns and curfews, the private sector implemented social-distancing and remote work policies, and hand-washing techniques took over the media. However, a forgotten section of frontline workers -sanitation workers- with poor access to safe water, decent sanitation and good hygiene (WASH) facilities continued to labor under hazardous working conditions and lack of government support. 
<br />
In 1993 and 2013, the practice of manual scavenging was outlawed by the Indian government. Even after a 30-year long ban, the practice continues unabated. As per 2021 estimates by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, there are 58,098 manual scavengers in India (Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, 2021). The numbers may be an underestimation of reality as the majority of them belong to the socially marginalized sections of the Indian caste system known as the Dalits. While it would be imperative to consider the cultural sensitivity of the manual scavenging issue, and might require an assessment of the caste system responsible for marginalization of the community, we limit our study to behavior change at the individual and community level.  
<br />
The research and knowledge implications of the proposed study is to understand the nuances of the failure to improve sanitation in India. The study provides an opportunity to reflect back on the past commitments and interventions by the government, in order to identify the reasons for failure and the absence of change in status quo. 

##Problem Statement

<br />
A lack of sanitary infrastructure and end-to-end services for human waste has resulted in an informal market solution that relies heavily on governance failures, market failures, and cultural status quo. The state has failed to improve sanitation infrastructure and provide the bare minimum provisions to re-employ manual scavengers who are forced to fill the gap of poor sanitary conditions in India. This discriminatory practice continues to fuel the informal market solution. 

##Key Concepts on Market Failure 
<br />
Manual scavenging is persistent for several reasons, primary among them being a governance failure. In areas where sanitary infrastructure exists and is operable, their upkeep is in part being done by the dalit community, and where the systems are incomplete, the dalits fill in the gaps. In both instances the government has failed to address the issue of infrastructure creation and maintenance, and instead opted to permit the situation to resolve itself. In the absence of inadequate infrastructure, social marginalization and lack of other economic opportunities, the dalits from the scheduled caste have had to step in. This natural resolution to the crisis contributes to the paradigm that is perpetuated across most states in India. 
<br />
However, the governance failure is only one of the contributing factors. The private sector of the market has also not stepped up. It has instead allowed the informal market to continue to produce a solution to the underdeveloped system that the governance structures had put into place. This hands-off approach has resulted in a notable lack of creativity in finding innovative/out of the box solutions that could remove the human requirement to do this work or at least give them tools to do the job more safely.
<br />
This perfect storm has resulted in an informal market that fails to value the labor of manual scavengers appropriately. Their labor is so undervalued that they are relegated to cleaning up the waste systems that no other entity is interested in fully managing. Since there are no other kinds of work available to this group and they need to make money to survive, their desperation allows the governance structures and market to persist, maintaining the status quo. And thus the cycle continues as before. Because this work exists beyond the formal sector, the mental and physical health repercussions are not even spoken about. The lack of social insurance for the Dalit population only deepens the problem.
<br />
If the labor of manual scavengers was valued appropriately, not only could they be granted the dignity in their work that all humans deserve, but the country could benefit from the economic gains of the appropriate valuation labor. By releasing the constraints on this group of workers and allowing them to reach into the wider market, their wellbeing and contributions to society would both be amplified.

##Geographic Focus
<br />
The scope of this study will be limited to the northern state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), which is the fourth largest state in terms of area and the most populous state of India. According to official data published by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, out of the total 58,098 manual scavengers in the country, Uttar Pradesh accounts for 32,473 people. 
<br />
As per the National Survey 2013, 2018 National Safai Karamcharis Finance & Development, 3 districts which have the highest reported numbers of manual scavengers; Budaon (2,866), Shahjahanpur (3,391) and Farrukhabad (1,040) will be taken into account (Goan Connection, 2022). Based upon further exploratory data analysis we will elect to focus on either urban or rural areas. 

##Program Description  
<br />
Our intervention attempts to address the discrepancies that have contributed to  the dehumanization of manual scavengers and their exploitation within the broader sanitation system. It aims to build the capacity of manual scavengers themselves in transitioning to the employment fields of their choice. We will exploit an exogenous change in the form of a Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment announcement to implement the 100% mechanical desludging of septic tanks and sewers to transition from manhole to machine-hole sanitation. We will compare a control population in UP of manual scavengers in areas affected by this change, to treatment populations of manual scavengers receiving a combination of employment-related training/services, mentorship, and certification, vs. a treatment population receiving an equivalent cash transfer. Assessment of the various populations’ employment outcomes over time will allow us to characterize the efficacy of these re-employment initiatives against cash. 
<br />
Because we believe that the binding constraint is social exclusion and discrimination towards manual scavengers, by employers. Scavengers lack training, networks, cultural capital (pertaining to their employment field of choice), and credibility amongst forma sector employers. Hence, a certification or ‘badge’ could signal scavengers’ worth to potential employers. The exact form and symbology of this requires further research into what will be most salient in the Indian cultural context, in addition to focus groups and discussions with employers about their attitudes towards scavengers and what would help to ameliorate them. 
	
##Mechanisms 
<br />
Some of the testable implication of the results would include: 
<ol>
<li> Number of workers re-assigned to new work </li>
<li> Public perception and change in number of instances of public defecation in specific areas that may be more prone to it </li>
</ol>

<br />
Implications are further discussed below. Null results would be useful in identifying the level of efficacy of the various arms, in which respect our hypotheses are: 
<br />
H_0: Access to employment training, services, employment, and mentorship will not improve the likelihood of manual scavengers’ transitioning to the desired non-sanitation employment of their choice, subject to an exogenous mechanization of their labor. 
<br />
H_1: Access to employment training, services, employment, and mentorship will improve the likelihood of manual scavengers’ transitioning to the desired non-sanitation employment of their choice, subject to an exogenous mechanization of their labor. 

##A Cluster-Randomized Control Trial: Design and Data Collection 

<br />
We plan to perform exploratory data analysis and obtain descriptive statistics from several databases, regarding the incidence (geographical and temporal) of manual scavenging, open defecation, and other key sanitation indicators throughout areas of India with known deaths of manual scavengers, specifically in Uttar Pradesh, which has the highest (reported) incidence of manual scavenging. 
<br />
We will conduct a mixed-methods evaluation. Firstly, this will consist of quantitative evaluation, consisting of: 
* Baseline survey 
* Midline survey (6 months after intervention)
* Endline survey (12 months after intervention)
<br />
We propose conducting a Cluster Randomized Control Trial (RCT). Cluster RCT’s have seen increasing use in the global health field (Dron et al., 2021), and are particularly common in Water, Sanitation & Hygiene (WASH) studies. WASH interventions are typically delivered at a group level (such as the construction of a new improved well at a village, school, or neighborhood), lending themselves to the clustering approach. Cluster RCT’s also have the benefit of improved (perceived) external validity, owing from the fact that trials of interventions at the community level have a greater resemblance to a scaled intervention, in logistical terms (Dron et al., 2021), than for an individual RCT. 
<br />
We will consult and work with the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to decide upon the unit of randomization of sanitation mechanization within UP, likely at either the district or village level. This will be based upon the administrative level to which the funding for the desludging machines will be allocated. 

<br />
The Cluster RCT will have 2 Treatment Arms and 1 Control Arm: 
* Control Arm: Infrastructure projects happening, but we do NOT implement any intervention, i.e. we treat the location-specific government mechanization as an exogenous change
* Treatment Arm 1: In areas where sanitation mechanization is happening, we will provide some combination of job training, certification, employment services, mentorship, etc. 
* Treatment Arm 2:  In areas where sanitation mechanization happening, provide cash transfer as comparison with Treatment Arm 1, where the cash transfer is equivalent in value to the amount spent in the 2nd arm 

<br />
Key employment outcomes (not an exhaustive list) that will be measured and assessed during the baseline survey include: 

* Percentage employed in manual scavenging (defined as those who remove excreta from pit latrines, remove fecal sludge, clean storm water drains, sewers, or drainage tanks, perform waste segregation, or remove waste dropped from railway lines)
	* Time spent per week performing each of these tasks
	* Money earned (INR) per week performing each of these tasks
* Percentage of manual scavengers that would like to continue working in the sanitation sector
* Type of employment (public sector/private sector/contractual/daily wage)
* Percentage using PPE (personal protective equipment) 
	* Percentage aware of the importance of PPE in health & safety terms  
* Percentage aware of machinery that could be used in place of manual scavengers 
* Percentage using tools required for engaging in manual scavenging work 
* Percentage employed in other sanitation (non-manual scavenging) occupations
	* Self-estimation of incomes (e.g. per hour, per month, etc. in INR) when the  participant is surveyed  
* Percentage employed in non-sanitation occupations 	 
	* Self-estimation of incomes (e.g. per hour, per month, etc. in INR) when the participant is surveyed 
* Experience with job search in other sectors or with other employers?
	* I.e. Have you tried to seek jobs in other sectors; if so, which sectors, and what methods did you employ in your search?  
* Number of manual scavengers aware of the government schemes specific to the sector (list of existing government schemes)
* Number aware of a one-time cash transfer program by the government targeted towards manual scavenging workers 
* Number who actually received the aforementioned one-time cash transfer from the government
* Self-perception of whether their income is sufficient to meet their basic daily needs for survival for themselves and their household 

<br />
* Key outcomes that will be measured and assessed at midline and endline include: 
	* Percentage of trainings attended
	* For attrited participants, attempt to determine the reasons for their dropping out
* Awareness: Number of other people whom each participant told about the program   
* Number of migrant workers aware about job fairs
* Number/Percentage of job fairs attended 
* Number of connections made with employers 
* Criteria related to range of jobs accepted 
	* Maximum commuting time in hours 
	* Wages 
	* Requires flexible working hours (e.g. to balance child/elder care commitments) 
	* Part-time vs. full-time 
* Criteria related to job search effort 
	* Number of applications submitted 
	* Number of interview invited to
	* Number of interviews attended 
* Questions related to self-perceived food security 
* Questions assessing self-perceived psychosocial health
* Questions related to change in employment status  


##Anticipated Concerns and Complications  

<ol>
<li> **Cost:** In terms of feasibility, cost is a primary concern for any RCT. As Cluster RCT’s are generally larger than individual RCT’s (Dron et al., 2021), they require greater financial resources. </li>


<li> **Geographic Focus:** According to official statistics, the bulk of manual scavenging in India occurs in urban areas. It would thus be natural to focus our intervention and study in urban areas where manual scavenging is common. However, the CLTS approach has been largely deployed in rural areas of the Global South, and limited evidence exists concerning its suitability and efficacy in urban areas. In particular, one of the pillars/assumptions underlying the CLTS approach -a high level of social capital and interrelationships- may not necessarily be present in dense, relatively anonymous urban neighborhoods. In the absence of such, however, preliminary evidence suggests that increasing returns to scale from neighbors adopting sanitation technology may substitute (Deutschmann et al., 2021). </li>


<li> **Cultural Considerations regarding Certification:** Our prior is that certification for the (largely) Dalit population of manual scavengers will improve their employment outcomes in non-sanitation sectors. However, the certification, if poorly or inappropriately designed, could have the potential to serve as a negative signal and further ostracize manual scavengers in the employment marketplace. </li>


<li> **Demand vs. Supply:** Our intervention characterizes the issue as a demand-issue; that manual scavengers are motivated to seek better, more humane employment, and merely lack the skills/training (and/or certification) to obtain such. If however, employer discrimination is sufficiently entrenched, then an intervention addressing employer sensitization to such and changing hiring attitudes may be more effective. </li>    


<li> **Survey Participation:** Because manual scavenging is such a sensitive topic, and those who perform it are so severely socially marginalized, it may be very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a large enough survey sample of scavengers willing to discuss these sensitive questions </li>


<li> **Treatment Arms:** Given random assignment, how do we ensure that the 3 arms (2 treatments and 1 control) are balanced in relevant characteristics? Also, how can we ensure, depending upon the unit of randomization (district vs. village vs. household), that there are no spillovers, e.g. of knowledge from the employment training, or of cash, from the cash transfers. </li>


<li> **Further Research on Intervention Type:** As little as five years ago, Bangladesh had a similar issue with human suffering from manual scavenging in urban centers such as Dhaka. However, the country has made substantial project on the issue recently. Further research on these successes will be informative for designing our intervention and evaluation in the Indian context. </li>


<li> **Ethics:** The topic of manual scavenging in India is culturally sensitive, and intersects with societal and class divides, particularly with respect to caste. Any attempt to change behaviour and norms must contend with these challenges. </li>
