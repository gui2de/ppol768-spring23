Manual Scavenging in India: A Combined Infrastructure Subsidy and 
Behaviour Change Approach

I. Introduction 

As defined under Section 2(1)(g) of the “Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (MS Act, 2013)”, “Manual scavenger” means a person engaged or employed, at the commencement of this Act or at any time thereafter, by an individual or a local authority or an agency or a contractor, for manually cleaning, carrying, disposing of, or otherwise handling in any manner, human excreta in an insanitary latrine or in an open drain or pit into which the human excreta from the insanitary latrines is disposed of, or on a railway track or in such other spaces or premises, as the Central Government or a State Government may notify before the excreta fully decomposes in such manner as may be prescribed, and the expression “manual scavenging” shall be construed accordingly”.

Manual scavenging involves collection and disposal of human excreta from dry latrines, railway tracks, septic tanks and underground sewer systems without access to personal protective equipment, inadequate social protection and government support. The practice of manual scavenging is deeply entrenched in the caste system in India. There are numerous negative implications of this practice including the social stigma associated with communities forced to indulge in “dirty work”, health implications of coming in direct contact with human waste, economic implications of earning the bare minimum, as well as the human rights implication of the constitutional right to a dignified life being violated. In its totality, the problem of manual scavenging in India is an example of a major governance failure to improve sanitation in the country, irrespective of years of interventions and promises. 

Over the years, many schemes and initiatives have been undertaken that should have improved the situation and made India open defecation free. However, the functioning, utility and the behavior change that needs to follow has gone unchecked and unreported. In consequence, generations of people continue the forced labor of cleaning excreta in sewers despite several technological and scientific advancements that should have made manual scavenging less labor-intensive.

Problem Statement 

The state has repeatedly failed to improve sanitation services and provide the bare minimum provisions to re-employ manual scavengers who are forced to fill the gap of poor sanitary conditions in India. It is a discriminatory practice that continues as an informal market solution to the governance failure of poor sanitation infrastructure.

Background and motivation
In 1993, the practice of manual scavenging was outlawed by the government. Even after a 30-year long ban on manual scavenging in India, the practice continues unabated. For the purpose of our study, we focus on the plight of manual scavengers in India accounting for 58,098 as per 2021 estimates by the government. However, the real numbers may be an underestimation because the majority of them belong to the socially marginalized sections of the Indian caste system known as the Dalits. While it would be imperative to consider the issue of manual scavenging as culturally sensitive to the country, and might require an assessment of the caste system responsible for marginalization of manual scavengers in the country, it requires interventions on a technological and infrastructural level. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, while the government imposed nationwide lockdowns and curfews, the private sector implemented social-distancing and remote work policies, and hand-washing techniques took over the media. However, a forgotten section of frontline workers -sanitation workers- with poor access to safe water, decent sanitation and good hygiene (WASH) facilities continued to labor under hazardous working conditions and lack of government support. 

Research and Knowledge Implications

The research and knowledge implications of the proposed study is to understand the nuances of government failure to improve sanitation in India. The study aims to explore a problem inherent to the social fabric of India, through the lens of government failure. The study also provides an opportunity to reflect back on the past commitments and interventions by the government, in order to identify the reasons for failure and no change in status quo. 

II. Proposed Intervention: 

 	Market Failure
In the context of manual scavenging, our research group has noted a governance failure that contributes to the current poor sanitation paradigm. Formally, this constitutes a collective action problem resulting from negative health externalities. The government has failed to provide end to end human waste management. They lack infrastructural and public works related to human waste management including, but not limited to, public piping systems that connect homes and businesses to the sewage system and a robust workforce of government funded sanitation workers to maintain the system. This has created a hole in the market that the informal economy has been able to fill, unfortunately at great risk to the individuals who have taken on the work. This ‘solution’ has been a stop gap within an incomplete system and is not the most efficient use of resources. One can see this most obviously in the way the workers are treated: quite literally as disposable. The death of workers is a loss of labor and an inefficiency/moral failure of the current system, and a waste of human capital. 

It is difficult to address the root causes of the issue here, but our group has chosen to focus on a combined intervention encompassing governance, infrastructure, and employability. The first treatment arm includes subsidies for creation and installation of hygienic latrines and piping, especially in underserved locations, and mechanical desludging machinery for all areas that are currently using manual labor. The second treatment arm includes re-employing manual scavengers in jobs that are dignified such that they are not forced from the workforce completely. A third treatment arm includes campaigns/enforcement of punishment for open defecation.

Theory of Change
Our intention with a three-pronged approach is to address various areas of governance failure:
1.	The first arm on latrine subsidies addresses the physical public works infrastructure that is lacking.
2.	The second arm on re-employment anticipates the market shift that would be precipitated by a successful launch of the project and to keep employment up which in turn will help public perception. 
3.	The third intervention aims to change community and social norms regarding open defecation and attitudes towards manual scavengers. (We assume that this could in part be addressed by point 1.)
Based upon further exploratory data analysis we will elect to focus on either urban or rural areas. We will likely focus on the states which have the highest reported manual scavenging death rate: Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.
Some of the testable implication of the results would include: 
1.	The counterfactual number of infrastructural units (toilets, piping, etc) put in place
2.	Number of workers re-assigned to new work
3.	Public perception and change in number of instances of public defecation in specific areas that may be more prone to it
Implications are further discussed below. Null results would be useful in identifying the level of efficacy of the various arms.

Relevance

The research our group would like to conduct has several avenues for learning. If the installation of additional toilets improves the management of human waste and fewer manual scavengers have to risk their life and dignity, then there is a possibility that this intervention could be scaled in other parts of the country or world. Even if there is not full success, we could evaluate alternative work paths available to the lowest caste of India. Finally we could see to what degree public opinion could be manipulated by campaigns/enforcement of anti-public defecation efforts. 
This kind of work can be used to further efforts in re-employment and waste management at large.

III. Measurement Approach: A Cluster-Randomized Control Trial 

Design and Data Collection

We plan to perform exploratory data analysis and obtain descriptive statistics from several databases, regarding the incidence (geographical and temporal) of manual scavenging, open defecation, and other key sanitation indicators throughout areas of India with known deaths of manual scavengers, including Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. 

We will conduct a mixed-methods evaluation. Firstly, this will consist of quantitative evaluation: Baseline survey, endline survey (6 months after intervention), for each of Treatment Arm 1, Treatment Arm 2, Treatment Arm 3, Control Arm.

We propose conducting a Cluster Randomized Control Trial (RCT). Cluster RCT’s have seen increasing use in the global health field (Dron et al., 2021), and are particularly common in Water, Sanitation & Hygiene (WASH) studies. WASH interventions are typically delivered at a group level (such as the construction of a new improved well at a village, school, or neighborhood), lending themselves to the clustering approach. Cluster RCT’s also have the benefit of improved (perceived) external validity, owing from the fact that trials of interventions at the community level have a greater resemblance to a scaled intervention, in logistical terms (Dron et al., 2021), than for an individual RCT. 
	
The Cluster RCDT will have 3 Treatment Arms and 1 control: 
→ TA 1: Subsidies for building hygienic latrines 
→ TA 2: Subsidies for mechanical desludging machinery 
→ TA 3: A Community-led Total Sanitation- (CLTS-) based information, motivation, and shaming campaign and intervention 
→ C: Control Arm

Key outcomes that will be measured and assessed at baseline and at endline include: 
●	Household access to, and ownership of, a hygienic latrine 
●	Open defecation rates 
●	Qualitative evaluations of manual scavenger’s self-perception of employability and public respect owing from the CLTS information/motivation campaign. 

Anticipated Concerns and Complications 

●	Cost: In terms of feasibility, cost is a primary concern for any RCT. As Cluster RCT’s are generally larger than individual RCT’s (Dron et al., 2021), they require greater financial resources. 
●	Geographic Focus: According to official statistics, the bulk of manual scavenging in India occurs in urban areas. It would thus be natural to focus our intervention and study in urban areas where manual scavenging is common. However, the CLTS approach has been largely deployed in rural areas of the Global South, and limited evidence exists concerning its suitability and efficacy in urban areas. In particular, one of the pillars/assumptions underlying the CLTS approach -a high level of social capital and interrelationships- may not necessarily be present in dense, relatively anonymous urban neighborhoods. In the absence of such, however, preliminary evidence suggests that increasing returns to scale from neighbors adopting sanitation technology may substitute (Deutschmann et al., 2021).   
●	Use of Subsidies: The use of subsidies is controversial (Guiteras et al., 2015), as some believe that they reduce internal motivation (in this case, to make sanitation investments). Are they the best way in the Indian sanitation context to address negative health externalities? 
●	Further Research on Intervention Type: As little as five years ago, Bangladesh had a similar issue with human suffering from manual scavenging in urban centres such as Dhaka. However, the country has made substantial project on the issue recently. Further research on these successes will be informative for designing our intervention and evaluation in the Indian context. 
●	Treatment Arms: Is 3 treatment arms too many? Are we trying to test too many things simultaneously? 
●	Ethics: The topic of manual scavenging in India is culturally sensitive, and intersects with societal and class divides, particularly with respect to caste. Any attempt to change behaviour and norms must contend with these challenges.
