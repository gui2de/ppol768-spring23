Project Pitch 

1. # Introduction

- ## Problem statement:

- 1. There are few opportunities for young people to build and strengthen their credit independently (i.e., without parental help/student loans)

- ## Context: 

- 1. Credit affects people’s ability to rent and buy homes, take out loans, and purchase affordable insurance and utility services.
  2. A credit builder (or building) loan (CBL) is a financial intervention to help borrowers establish and improve their credit scores by building their credit history through an accommodating loan payment structure.
  3. Larger, well-known banks are not incentivized to offer credit-building loans since borrowers with strong credit qualify for lower interest rate loans. 
  4. Credit unions (non-profit banks) are more likely to provide credit-building loans and programs for their members 
  5. Most CBLs require borrowers to make on-time monthly payments to improve their credit. Thus, standard CBLs are sometimes ineffective or even detrimental for people who fall behind on payments despite additional loan support.
  6. The Georgetown Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union addresses this issue in 2019 by offering a service that freezes the funds in a separate account, from which loan payments are automatically withdrawn each month. 

- ## Background

- 1. ## There have been few studies on whether credit builder loans (CBL) meaningfully improve recipients’ financial capabilities. In a systematic review of 24 financial capacity interventions, Birkenmaier and colleagues noted “the need to develop a more definitive evidence base for financial capability interventions.”

  2. Nonetheless, using an “intent-to-treat” design, Burke, et al. (2022) studied over 1500 credit union members to evaluate whether a stand-alone CBL improved low-income adults’ financial standing. The loaning institution structured the CBL such that borrowers received an automated deposit after making a preemptive monthly payment toward the loan. Participants’ payment history at baseline significantly predicted whether their credit score improved. Among those without existing debt, CBL borrowers’ were 24% more likely to have a credit score, which compared to participants with pre-existing loans, increased by an additional 60 pts.

  3. This project builds on prior CBL research by providing evidence of the crucial role of automation in designing effective CBLs, as well as strategies to improve young adults’ financial capabilities.

     

1. # Intervention

2. - ## Market failure: 

What mechanism is your intervention using to address the source of the issue?

1. The intervention is a credit-building loan with guaranteed,, automated monthly payments. The program uses payment automation and account security tools to build participants credit history while remaining robust against human error and external circumstances that could undermine its effectiveness.. 
2. The program provides youth with a low-risk alternative to using a credit card, student loans, or a cosigner to build credit. It also overcomes the need for routine monitoring, budgeting, and payments by requiring 0-1 payment prior to receiving the loan.

- Theory of change: 	

- 1. The credit union makes timely loan payments on behalf of loan borrowers to provide them with a history of timely payments and thus a higher credit score. Having a higher credit score would grow union members’ access to credit at lower interest rates. These advantages would help members secure other benefits, such as rental housing approvals and fair mortgage loans. ![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/b_Vq2k2NM7DNb1todo1-_G5QhUHxAwMc62lecDjn0n1xO8Y1xAuC5DKTwJW0SXDbENRs-y5NWBvqytlD7Yp1LWT4G2lquvRVx1J6JhRf3FRgJwocNY_Dbt50JtWPUFD_otnqVBfSxhwWbNasKlkAqXU)
  2. Whether participants’ credit scores rise and remain in good standing has implications for the effectiveness and sustainability of the program. 
  3. Similarly, evaluating the access, limits, rates, and usage of loans and credit cards would provide insight into how effective and relevant the program is at increasing beneficiaries’ access to credit. 
  4. Aside from implying that the CBL program was ineffective, null results could indicate a lagged effect or the need to identify and control for confounding factors. 

- Relevance/Implications:

- 1. The intervention could spur economic growth by encouraging entrepreneurship and community investments. 

  2. On the other hand, the CBL could exacerbate inequality and reduce the effectiveness of credit scores in predicting borrowing practices. 

  3. Intervention could be incorporated into federal loan programs for other underserved communities (e.g., Community Reinvestment Act). 

  4. We could compare results to other nudge-based interventions. 

  5. The program could have implications for automation in investing/wealth building

     

1. # Measurement

   - 1. What is the research design? 

     2. 1. Quasi-experimental discontinuity design around the program implementation threshold 

     3. The subjects? 

     4. 1. Random sample of GU undergrads and/or grads in the union just after the program was created

     5. The comparison groups? 

     6. 1. Random sample of GU undergrads and/or grads in the union just after the program was created

   - ## Data: 

   - 1. How will you measure outcomes (dependent variables)? 

     2. 1. Some measurements are defined (scores, credit limit, etc.)
        2. May create a basket of loans and corresponding rates

     3. How will you collect information (primary vs. secondary)? 

     4. 1. Request deidentified score data
        2. Collect survey data for undisclosed information

     5. How much will you collect and from whom?

     6. 1. ~200 PSUs (100 before and after implementation)

   - ## Complications: 

   - 1. What issues and complications do you foresee?

     2. 1. Non-repsonse and/or missing data

        2. Access to data and OVB

        3. Measurement bias

           

     3.  Timeline? When will you have results? 

     4. 1. Review the literature
        2. Inquire about data collection feasibility for given indicators
        3. Finalize indicators, model selection, and sampling frame
        4. Collect data
        5. Clean the dataset
