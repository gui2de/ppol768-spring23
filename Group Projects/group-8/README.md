# Project Pitch 

<hr> 
This reseach project would evaluate the impact of GASFCU’s automated credit-builder loan payment program on participants’ credit scores and financial capabilities. 
<hr>

### Introduction

* **Issue statement:**  Standard credit building loans are not an effective way for young people to build and strengthen their credit score without parental support or federal loans.

  1. Credit affects people’s ability to rent and buy homes, take out loans, and purchase affordable insurance and utility services.
  2. A credit builder (or building) loan (CBL) is a financial intervention to help borrowers establish and improve their credit scores by building their credit history through an accommodating loan payment structure.
  3. Larger, well-known banks are not incentivized to offer credit-building loans since borrowers with strong credit qualify for lower interest rate loans. 
  4. Credit unions (non-profit banks) are more likely to offer these programs. 
  5. Standard CBLs still require borrowers to make on-time monthly payments to improve their credit. Thus, standard CBLs are ineffective or even detrimental for people who fall behind on payments despite additional loan accomodations.
  6. The Georgetown Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union (GASFCU) addressed this issue in 2019 by offering a service that freezes the funds in a separate account and automatically draws from the accout each month to make timely loan payments on the borrowers’ behalf.<br><br>

### Background

There have been few studies on whether credit builder loans (CBL) meaningfully improve recipients’ financial capabilities. In a systematic review of 24 financial capacity interventions, Birkenmaier and colleagues noted “the need to develop a more definitive evidence base for financial capability interventions.” Nonetheless, using an “intent-to-treat” design, Burke, et al. (2022) studied over 1500 credit union members to evaluate whether a stand-alone CBL improved low-income adults’ financial standing. The loaning institution structured the CBL such that borrowers received an automated deposit after making a preemptive monthly payment toward the loan. Participants’ payment history at baseline significantly predicted whether their credit score improved. Among those without existing debt, CBL borrowers’ were 24% more likely to have a credit score, which compared to participants with pre-existing loans, increased by an additional 60 pts. This project builds on prior CBL research by providing evidence of the crucial role of automation in designing effective CBLs, as well as strategies to improve young adults’ financial capabilities.

## Intervention

#### Market failure 

1. The intervention is a credit-building loan with guaranteed,, automated monthly payments. The program uses payment automation and account security tools to build participants credit history while remaining robust against human error and external circumstances that could undermine its effectiveness.. 
2. The program provides youth with a low-risk alternative to using a credit card, student loans, or a cosigner to build credit. It also overcomes the need for routine monitoring, budgeting, and payments by requiring 0-1 payment prior to receiving the loan.

#### Theory of change: 
  
  1. The credit union makes monthly loan payments on behalf of loan borrowers. 
  2. Borrowers establish a history of timely payments and a higher credit score. 
  3. Having a higher credit score increases union members’ access to credit and lower interest rate loans.
  4. These advantages help members secure other benefits, such as rental housing approvals and fair mortgage loans.<br><br>

#### Implications
Whether participants’ credit scores rise and remain in good standing has implications for the effectiveness and sustainability of the program. Evaluating the access, limits, rates, and usage of loans and credit cards would provide insight into how effective and relevant the program is at increasing beneficiaries’ access to credit. Aside from implying that the CBL program was ineffective, null results could indicate a lagged effect or the need to identify and control for confounding factors. 

#### External relevance

  1. The intervention could spur economic growth by encouraging entrepreneurship and community investments. 
  2. On the other hand, the CBL could exacerbate inequality and reduce the effectiveness of credit scores in predicting borrowing practices. 
  3. Intervention could be incorporated into federal loan programs for other underserved communities (e.g., Community Reinvestment Act). 
  4. We could compare results to other nudge-based interventions. 
  5. The program could have implications for automation in investing/wealth building

## Methodology

   1. Design: Quasi-experimental discontinuity design around the program implementation threshold 
   2. Subjects: Random sample of GU undergrads and/or grads in the union just after the program was created
   3. Comparison groups: Random sample of GU undergrads and/or grads in the union just after the program was created

#### Data measurement
- Quantifiable outcomes (credit score, credit limit, etc.)
- Benchmarked basket of loans and corresponding average rates

#### Data collection 
- Request for deidentified credit score data
 - Source: Georgetown Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union
- Survey to collect data on credit limits, lines of credit, etc.
 - Source: ~200 PSUs (100 before and after implementation)
- Loan underwriters' reports of the loans and interest rates within the basket for which PSUs qualify 

#### Complications

 1. Access to data
 2. Survey non-repsonse and measurement bias
 2. Omitted and confounding variables
     
#### Timeline  

 1. Review the literature
 2. Inquire about data collection feasibility for given indicators
 3. Finalize indicators, model selection, and sampling frame
 4. Collect data
 5. Clean the dataset
 6. Analyze the data 
 7. Draft project report 
 8. Present findings 

#### Project duration: 3 months (May 2023)
