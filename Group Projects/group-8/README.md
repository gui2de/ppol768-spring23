### Introduction

* **Issue statement:**  Standard credit building loans are not an effective way for people to build and strengthen their credit score given the risk of falling behind on loan payments.

Credit affects people’s ability to rent and buy homes, take out loans, and purchase affordable insurance and utility services. A credit builder (or building) loan (CBL) is a financial intervention to help borrowers establish and improve their credit scores by building their credit history through an accommodating loan payment structure. Larger, well-known banks are not incentivized to offer credit-building loans since borrowers with strong credit qualify for lower interest rate loans. Credit unions (non-profit banks) are more likely to offer these programs. 

Standard CBLs still require borrowers to make on-time monthly payments to improve their credit. Thus, standard CBLs are ineffective or even detrimental to people who fall behind on payments. The Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union (GUASFCU) addressed this issue by offering a service that freezes the funds in a separate account and automatically draws from the account each month to make timely loan payments on the borrowers’ behalf.<br><br>

### Background

There have been few studies on whether credit builder loans (CBL) meaningfully improve recipients’ financial capabilities. In a systematic review of 24 financial capacity interventions, Birkenmaier and colleagues noted “the need to develop a more definitive evidence base for financial capability interventions.” Nonetheless, using an “intent-to-treat” design, Burke, et al. (2022) studied over 1500 credit union members to evaluate whether a stand-alone CBL improved low-income adults’ financial standing. The loaning institution structured the CBL such that borrowers received an automated deposit after making a preemptive monthly payment toward the loan. Participants’ payment history at baseline significantly predicted whether their credit score improved. Among those without existing debt, CBL borrowers’ were 24% more likely to have a credit score, which compared to participants with pre-existing loans, increased by an additional 60 pts. This project builds on prior CBL research by providing evidence of the crucial role of automation in designing effective CBLs, as well as strategies to improve young adults’ financial capabilities.

## Intervention

#### Market failure 

Timely loan payments toward traditional CBLs are subject to human error and extraneous circumstances. Such programs typically function as a savings account by requiring individuals to make payments toward the loan prior to receiving the funds. Individuals who cannot consistently afford and manage monthly payments fail to establish a favorable credit history and improve their credit score. The project intervention is thus an innovative credit-building loan program that automates monthly loan payments on the borrower’s behalf. 

#### Theory of change

The borrower (or their sponsor) pays the loan’s interest as a lump sum upfront to receive the loan. The banking institution then freezes the loan in a separate account and uses the funds to pay off the loan over a period of 18-36 months. In short, borrowers are guaranteed a history of on-time payments and a higher credit score (all else equal) without having to monitor the loan account or manage monthly payments. A higher credit score provides program participants with increased access to more diverse and affordable credit products, putting them in a better position to purchase property, invest in a business venture, and remain financially resilient in times of emergency. 

#### Implications for outcomes of interest

Whether participants’ credit scores rise and remain in good standing has implications for the effectiveness and sustainability of the program -- that is, whether the program achieves the desired outcomes and whether those outcomes are likely to persist. Other outcomes of interest that point to the program’s effectiveness include participants’ borrowing limits, interest rates, and approved credit options. Furthermore, overall credit use and the use of credit product features (e.g., reward points) signals the program’s impact, or whether the intervention makes a meaningful difference in participants’ lives. Null results along these parameters only could indicate that the outcomes of the program are not relevant to participants’ consumption, or that those effects are delayed. It could also indicate the need to address an important confounding or mediating factor, such as race or financial literacy.

#### Relevance

The intervention’s novel credit-building strategy represents a low-risk alternative for people without access to a cosigner or consistent income. Although the program is scalable to other institutions, an oversaturated market would reduce the effectiveness of credit scores in predicting credit worthiness. Still, promising results could provide evidence for streamlining additional end-user processes to promote saving and investing.

## Methodology

   1. Design: A quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design around the program's implementation threshold 
   2. Subjects: Random sample of GU undergrads and/or grads in the union just after the program was created
   3. Comparison groups: Random sample of GU undergrads and/or grads in the union just after the program was created

#### Data measurement
- Quantifiable outcomes (credit score, credit limit, etc.)
-  Benchmarked basket of loans and their corresponding average rates

#### Data collection 
- Request for deidentified credit score data
 - Source: Georgetown Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union
- Survey to collect data on credit limits, lines of credit, etc.
 - Source: ~200 PSUs (100 before and after implementation)
- Loan underwriters' reports of the loans and interest rates within the basket for which PSUs qualify 

#### Complications

 1. Access to data
 2. Survey non-response and measurement bias
 2. Omitted and confounding variables
     
#### Timeline  

 1. Review the literature
 2. Inquire about data collection feasibility for given indicators
 3. Finalize indicators, model selection, and sampling frame
 4. Collect data
 5. Clean the dataset
 6. Analyze the data 
 7. Draft project report 
 8. Present findings 

#### Project duration: 3 months (May 2023)
