Potential Issue: 

* Our project assesses the impact of a credit builder loan on students' financial capabilities and access to credit via a financial capabilities survey. If we were to expand our survey to students at different schools, we'd conduct high frequency checks to assess enumerator errors and gauge whether respondents understanding the questions. Detecting and addressing these incongruencies would help improve data quality and the overall data collection process.

High Frequency Check:

* We use a repurposed dataset to conduct high frequency checks that flag potential incongruencies in survey responses. One check identifies cases with contradictory values for selected variables that recorded Likert scale responses. The output provides a summary of the contradictory data points for each variable to help the field manager address these issues.

* Table 1 compares respondent's estimated likelihood that they will open an account with the student credit union with their estimated likelihood that they will apply for the loan. Responses are contradictory if they say they will probably or definitely going to apply for a loan but are unlikely to or wouldn't open an account, since opening an account is necessary to apply for a loan. 

* Table 2 compares self assessed likelihood of opening an account with likelihood of receiving the loan. Since it is impossible to get a loan without opening an account, responses are determined to be contradictory if respondents estimate that they will probably or definitely get a loan but are unlikely to or will not open and account. 

* Table 3 compares estimated likelihood of applying for a loan with estimated likelihood of receiving a loan. Since it it impossible to receive the loan without applying for it, responses that indicate a higher estimated likelihood of receiving the loan and a lower estimated likelihood of applying for the loan are contradictory.

Figure 2: Y axis refers to enumerator ID. 

Below is a table corresponding to Figure 1 and Figure 2 which shows invalid responses, average time taken to complete survey administered by each enumerator, and sample size that each enumerator was responsible for. 

| eid  | einvalid | edurat~n | ssize |
| ---- | -------- | -------- | ----- |
| 1    | 2        | 32.23542 | 180   |
| 2    | 0        | 23.97129 | 123   |
| 3    | 5        | 31.75631 | 145   |
| 4    | 1        | 24.786   | 149   |
| 5    | 5        | 47.8195  | 212   |
| 6    | 2        | 21.70409 | 210   |
| 7    | 2        | 27       | 184   |
| 8    | 3        | 20.39005 | 274   |
| 9    | 7        | 28       | 176   |
| 10   | 2        | 28.7919  | 226   |
| 11   | 4        | 48.15093 | 241   |

There do not appear to be any obvious outliers among the enumerators in regards to invalid response rate, nor does there appear to be significant relationship between average time taken to complete a survey and invalid response rate or between survey completion time and sample size. This information would suggest to a field manager that enumerators were properly administering the survey.
