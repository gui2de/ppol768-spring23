## 1. Introduction

### Problem Statement:
“Colombia's government has attempted to reduce these percentages by lowering the cost of formalization, creating chambers of commerce to promote registration, increasing capacity for inspection and enforcement, and more actively supporting formal business”(IPA,2023). These are some of the strategies implemented by the Colombian government to reduce the prevalence of informal businesses in the economy. A diverse strategy aimed at providing support to public and private stakeholders in the business sector is needed. 
The structure and form of women’s entrepreneurial pursuits are adversely impacted by family norms, cultures, policies and regulations (Dávilia and Lluch,2022). Globally, 30% of women are self-employed in this informal sector. ( Muhammad et al  2021). Women entrepreneurs face a number of constraints which hinder their ability to grow their businesses. We anticipate that free childcare will provide the opportunity for a flexible schedule for women to formally register their businesses. 

### Background and Motivation: 
The informal sector creates a gap between the amount of  tax revenue generated and the amount that is actually collected. The high rate of informal businesses makes it difficult for the government to collect taxes  and that adversely impacts economic development (IMF, 2020).The informal sector represents on average 35% of GDP in low and middle income countries (IMF, 2021). We expect that this research will reveal that an increase in business registration will have a positive effect on productivity of female entrepreneurs. The influx of migrants from neighboring Venezuela presents an opportunity for tax revenue as migrants are expected to establish their own informal businesses. 

## 2. Intervention
There have been policies implemented to increase the rate of formalization in Colombia, however, the current data shows that informality still hovers at around 60% of total employment. The Colombian government has carried out endeavors to help businesses formalize that focus on information provision and regulatory improvements. Examples of these policies are the Ventanilla Única Empresarial, which is a one stop shop for the steps and forms needed to formalize a business and INVIMA, which is the simplification and reduction of forms needed to become a formal business. Below is a diagram provided by Colombia’s government in the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism website of the simplified process to formalize a business. The diagram also provides information regarding the reduced cost of the process; .7% of the business assets paid in the first step.

 Another important strategy that has been implemented are a series of information campaigns funded by different government bodies to promote the benefits of formalization. All of these strategies have tried to address the economic and informational barriers entrepreneurs face when making the decision to formalize or not. Even though these policies have been implemented, the market failure of high informality persists. This means that the monetary resources being spent in the formalization efforts are not productive. Our research project aims to find proof that targeting economic and informational barriers is not efficient for women entrepreneurs because they choose to stay informal due to personal reasons. The exact personal reason we target is the incentive of schedule flexibility as a parent. 

### Theory of Change: 
|ToC Component|Explanation|
|:----------------:|:----------------------------------------:|
|Goals and objectives |Increase formalization among women entrepreneurs |
|Inputs|Free childcare arrangements for the entrepreneurs in the treatment group |
|Activities|Participants will continue receiving the resources about formalizing their business from the government. In addition, the treatment group will receive childcare|
|Outputs|Women will formalize their business because they will have flexibility over their own schedule since their children are being taken care of| 
|Outcomes|Inform policymakers to better target the incentives for people to be in the informal economy so that they can formalize their business| 
|Impact|Better policies will be created to increase formalization. Further research on behavioral incentives as reasons to stay informal will be inspired| 
|Assumptions|We are assuming women mothers care about the wellbeing of their children and their household, which motivates them to want to take care of them. This means that we assume this sector of entrepreneurs chooses family over economic growth| 


### Relevance:
The expected results of our research are that women will formalize their informal business once they have childcare provided. From this, we aim to show that monetary motivations alone will not work to incentivize formalization. The government must address entrepreneurs' personal incentives for choosing informality. It is important to understand the nonmonetary incentives for informality so they can be efficiently addressed. The strategies that have been attempted have not been successful in decreasing the rates of informality because a thorough analysis of why entrepreneurs self-select into the informal economy is not taken into account. Since our project will focus on one of the many incentives that exist, it will inspire further research to measure the effect of other personal incentives such as social pressure to stay informal. 

## 3. Measurement

### Research Design:
The research will be designed to compare the impact of childcare support toward the formalization of female owned businesses with other programs. The research subjects will be informal female entrepreneurs raising children under high school age in Bogota. For all subjects, childcare support will be provided as a form of coupon to send their children to the childcare center, so that they can pay just a portion of the total amount using the coupon. (“Child Care Coupon”, or “CCC”) Regardless of registering their business or not, they can get the childcare support for six months.

|Control Group|Informal female entrepreneurs raising children under high school age in Bogota RECEIVING Information campaign|
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|Treatment Group|Informal female entrepreneurs raising children under high school age in Bogota RECEIVING CCC|


### Data Measure:
Number of formalized businesses and proportions of business formalization within the Control Group and Treatment Group each are data to be measured. Relevant information will be investigated randomly on the street for informal female entrepreneurs, and investigators will ask if they have children and request research participation. After the experiment, the business registration information will be collected from the Ministry of Commerce Industry and Tourism (MoCIT) website. As of now, we are targeting a total 50 subjects considering limited resources for the Information Campaign.

### Complications:
We foresee the effect of formalization may not be sustainable. For example, if the period of coupon ends, there is a possibility that the business registration will be withdrawn, and  go back to informal business again. Also, calculating how much coupon discounts will require a bunch of relevant data with complexity. This is because the amount should be the same as that of the Information Campaign considering the budget constraint. In addition, the research periods would take longer than usual since the coupon will last for 6 months. Given the data analyzing process for about 2 more months, the final result will be available at least 8 months after the research starts.
