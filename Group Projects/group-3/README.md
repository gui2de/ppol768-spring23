# Employee Wellness Programs in Rural America

## Introduction

Americans continue to experience an array of health issues such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease (CDC, 2020), in part, due to factors such as poor nutrition and low physical activity (Roglic, 2016).
Health ailments negatively impact not only individuals and their families but society at large, carrying financial burdens for agents such as employers and health insurance companies (Carlson et al., 2015; Jardim et al., 2019).
For example, employers are affected by employee health through absenteeism, productivity, and employer-sponsored health insurance costs (Baicker et al., 2010; Berry et al., (2010); Boles et al., 2004; Gubler et al., 2017).
Specifically, less healthy employees are shown to be more likely to take paid sick leave (Davis et al., 2005), be less effective at their jobs (Gubler et al., 2017), and raise employee health insurance premiums (Pearson & Lieber, 2009).

An array of approaches are being adopted in an effort to encourage healthier eating habits and increase exercise (Gubler et al., 2017; Kirgios et al., 2020).
Employee wellness programs (EWPs) are thought to be one way to not only improve the health and wellbeing of employees, but also reduce the externalized costs of poor health (Baicker et al. 2010).
EWPs are employer sponsored methods to encourage healthier employee behaviors.
These programs take multiple forms such as gym memberships, smoking cessation programs, biometric screenings, and nutritional guidance.
Research not only finds that these programs result in increases in physical activity, healthier eating habits, and improvements in employee well-being (Torres & Zhang, 2021), but also increases in worker productivity by 10% (Gubler et al., 2017) and reductions in health insurance claims on the order of \$1,421 per year per participant (Berry et al., 2020).

The current study investigates the effect of a free 10-week gym membership (including a personal trainer) on healthcare costs and medication expenses in a rural small business environment.
Specifically, a difference in difference regression model will be used to estimate the impact an EWP has on employees working in small businesses.The results from this study can provide insight into alternative methods of improving the health and wellbeing of Americans in rural areas.

## Intervention

With millions of Americans accessing health insurance or benefits through their employer there are clear economic benefits to improving employee health (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2021).
First, from a market perspective, introducing employee wellness programs can help reduce cases of adverse selection in health coverage.
Individuals believing they will need more care related to health issues are more inclined to select high priced plans that cover more conditions.
This, in turn, forces low-risk employees to pay higher premiums to receive equal coverage (Cutler & Zeckhauser, 1998).
Sufficient uptake of a wellness program will theoretically reduce issues of adverse selection by lowering the premium costs on high-coverage plan through reduced use, thereby also encouraging low-risk individuals to more frequently select high-coverage plans, and improving the risk pool.

Further, EWPs help reduce the risk of moral hazard behavior.
With sufficient incentive to engage in the benefits program individuals who are in poor health may be inclined to engage in health improving behavior.
With sufficient health coverage, employees may not feel that making lifestyle adjustments promoting their health is a valued use of time, as they can fall back on an insurance safety net.
Discounts in place for employees engaging with the wellness program could provide sufficient incentive for insured individuals to alter this behavior.

Interventions demonstrating increased uptake of wellness related behavior (e.g. use of personal trainer and gym membership), improved health biomarkers in insurance evaluations, and decreased use of healthcare services will provide evidence that similar workplaces may benefit from the inclusion of a gym membership and personal trainer appoints in EWPs.
In contrast, lack of evidence supporting these outcomes suggests that alternative incentives - either positive or negative - or extended intervention period may be necessary to improve employee health.

Positive results can also demonstrate the need for including training support within EWPs to achieve consistent results.
If other studies without personal training regimens demonstrate insignificant results, a positive finding within this study could suggest that training support is a critical component to improve uptake.

However, there may be alternative influences guiding engagement with an EWP.
For example, privacy concerns may deter some participants from engaging with an EWP.
Health data is highly sensitive.
Regardless of protections that may be in place, individuals may feel that employers could be influenced by information gleaned through the wellness program, or worse, use information of chronic health conditions as leverage in salary negotiations (Hendricks-Sturrup et al., 2020).Evidence of privacy concerns could indicate the presence of selection bias, and individuals more likely to harbor data privacy concerns may be underrepresented in the sample.

Further, descriptive statistics for individuals opting out of the EWP should be assessed to determine if the structure of the program could be introducing some form of discrimination.
Individuals with more constrained schedules, such as single-parents, lower-income workers juggling multiple jobs, or more stressed and vulnerable populations may find it more difficult to adhere to the demands of a wellness program (Hull & Pasquele, 2018).
Assuming these programs are coupled with some form of financial incentive, this creates an implicit penalty for already marginalized employees.
If structural discrimination is identified in the results subsequent research can identify methods to ameliorate these outcomes.

## Measurement

### *Design*

There are many factors that may influence a person's participation in an EWP.
For example, demographic and sociological factors are known to influence participation in EWPs (DeMoranville et al., 1998).
More specifically, employees with active lifestyles, higher levels of formal education, or those who had higher status in the hierarchy in the company would be more likely to participate.
Other factors likely to influence employee participation include education, minority status, tenure, age, and supervisor status (Pink-Harper & Rauhaus, 2017).
The study is designed in an attempt to mitigate these anticipated biases as much as possible.
In order to provide empirical evidence for hypothesis testing, the study uses a longitudinal field investigation with treatment and control groups.
The study focuses on the effect of a free 10-week gym membership and personal trainer included in the EWP on healthcare costs and medication expenses associated with the treatment of comorbidities of obesity for employees within small rural companies.

The research subjects are from small businesses and companies in rural areas, as these companies differ in composition compared to the widely studied large industries, such as tech or hospitality.
Participating companies must be small and ideally similar enough in services provided that they can be compared as treatment and control groups.
For example, notary, dentist, or tax preparation offices are small businesses with relatively sedentary jobs.
The treatment group will have access to an EWP that includes the free gym membership and personal trainer, and the control group will not.
The field experiment will include companies from different regions of the United States.
The minimum number of research participants is 400.

### *Data*

The primary goal of this study is to determine whether promotion of exercise, at no cost to the employee, results in a reduction in treatment of the comorbidities of obesity compared to usual medical care costs in small companies.
This is particularly relevant because small businesses do not have the same access to monetary resources and revenue as larger mainstream companies in urban areas.
The study establishes a baseline cost of current medications and number of health care visits for each employee, along with changes in body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and laboratory values after completion of a 10-week gym membership program.

Laboratory data are collected bi-weekly, to include weight measurements.
The number of times a subject visits a gym and uses a personal trainer is also recorded.
Lastly, questionnaires are collected at the beginning and end of the study and six months after the study is complete.
This study assumes that changing one's behavior to include consistent physical exercise would decrease obesity and associated comorbidities, along with decreased health care visits and lower costs of medication.
A decrease in healthcare expenses would demonstrate an economic benefit for employers that would be significant enough to offer free gym membership coverage for all their employees.

### *Complications*

EWPs ideally offer the same benefits to all employees, but not all EWPs are the same and employees are not required to participate in EWPs.
It may be an issue that the most likely to benefit from an EWP are the least likely to participate.
Additionally, anticipated enjoyment of exercise is a well-documented barrier to engaging in exercise (Ruby et al., 2011).
Employees that are already physically active outside of work are more likely to already be participating in EWPs and are also more likely to take advantage of the free gym membership and personal trainer.
Whereas employees that are not used to regular physical activity, may need additional incentives to make exercise part of their regular routine.
Attrition may result due to the requirement for active collection of data (bi-weekly labs and weigh-ins).
To minimize this, the data should be collected as efficiently as possible, with minimal impediment on the subjects regular schedule, but without compromising collection requirements (eg. fasting before a blood sample).
A passive data collection option may reduce attrition, such as wearable devices like an Oura ring, but this option will increase the cost of the study.
This study will consist of 10 weeks of active data collection, and will conclude after the six-month follow up survey is completed (appx 8.5 months).
