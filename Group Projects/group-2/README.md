# Introduction

## Problem statement

*What is the issue? The issue cannot be "people are poor" or "resources are insufficient".*

Rural female artisan entrepreneurs in Tunisia face challenges in participating in the economy due to the lack of connection between the Tunisian banking system and the international banking system. This hinders the internationalization of their businesses. To empower these artisans, it is important to evaluate whether mobile money could serve as a solution to this obstacle.

## Background and motivation

*Why should we care? What are the research and knowledge implications of trying to solve this problem?*

25% of all employed women in Tunisia work in the craft sector, which accounts for 3.9% of the country’s GDP and it is mostly concentrated in rural Tunisia. However, female artisans in Tunisia lack economic participation, accounting only for 13% of the total entrepreneurs.

Interestingly, women are present in a multitude of occupations and play an important role in civic society, with representation in human and labor rights organizations ([Moghadam, 2019](https://online.ucpress.edu/socdev/article-pdf/5/4/337/395369/sod_2019_5_4_337.pdf?casa_token=R9QQ5Hds2YsAAAAA:lEPWJnIH7DrmUesHqZ-h53A3_Ktd4witDr7WEiDM1ZXArObzqOcXcTjVyng-eg6tR3CE1jKg)). This is thanks to the establishment of the Tunisian constitution in 2014, when the country significantly progressed in the advancement of its gender equality agenda ([Yerkes & McKeown, 2018](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/11/30/what-tunisia-can-teach-united-states-about-women-s-equality-pub-77850)).  Yet women’s economic participation remains extremely stunted, especially when it comes to entrepreneurship. Women face challenges in accessing information, markets and financial services ([OECD, 2020](https://www.oecd.org/competition/changing-laws-and-breaking-barriers-for-women-s-economic-empowerment-in-egypt-jordan-morocco-and-tunisia-ac780735-en.htm)). They experience certain barriers in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, such as access to markets even if there are plenty of trade agreements facilitating the internationalization of their businesses. This is mostly because the Tunisian banking system is not connected to the international banking system interfering with the internationalization of business activities.

In fact, the EU is Tunisia’s greatest trading partner, accounting for 48.3% of Tunisia’s imports and receiving over 70% of Tunisia’s exports. For which the EU Free trade agreement ([Grumiller et al., 2018](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/268173/1/RR08.pdf)) provides an opportunity to access markets for rural entrepreneurs. However, there is a mismatch between large established exporters and smaller artisans that lack knowledge of how to navigate such a complicated banking system.

Banking penetration rate is low in Tunisia, averaging 34.6% in 2020, and 22.4% in rural areas ([Statista, 2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1270250/share-of-tunisians-owning-a-mobile-phone-by-area/#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20around%2093%20percent,the%20share%20exceeded%2096%20percent.)). Therefore paying rural artisans through traditional banking systems would be extremely difficult as shown below:

![Banking Structure](img/bankingstructure.png)

In this context, and with the existing payment solutions, we believe the payment solutions that are best suited to support rural female artisan entrepreneurs in Tunisia are:

- **Mobile money**: it can be used to pay rural women for their services and products with the only requirement of a cellphone (smart-phone penetration is approximately at 85%, [Statista, 2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1270250/share-of-tunisians-owning-a-mobile-phone-by-area/#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20around%2093%20percent,the%20share%20exceeded%2096%20percent.)). Mobile money users can cash out and collect their balance either at kiosks or retail shops. However it is not widely used in the country as a form of receiving payments, specifically for rural artisans as their digital literacy lags behind ([Aid to Artisans, Tunisian Project](http://ata.creativelearning.org/building-export-capacity-in-tunisia-cap-x/)).
- **E-Dinar (Post Money)**: There are currently six million postal financial accounts ([Hyunh, 2014](https://www.cgap.org/blog/la-poste-tunisienne-powerful-tool-for-financial-inclusion#:~:text=La%20Poste%20is%20a%20powerful,the%20country%20%E2%80%93%201%2C050%20post%20offices.)), Account holders can collect cash on their way to the post offices.

However, accessing a postal office physically can be a barrier for some rural entrepreneurs, hence we are designing an intervention that will measure to what extent mobile money could present a better solution to the economic participation of rural female artisan entrepreneurs.

# Intervention

## Market failure
*What mechanism is your intervention trying to use to improve the situation?*

Even if Tunisia holds one of the highest ratios in the world for postal financial accounts, proving beneficial for its citizens, accessing a postal office is not possible for many rural female artisan entrepreneurs. On the other hand, even if mobile money can be an ideal solution for artisans, the lack of digital literacy is a barrier to benefit from this tool. Our intervention aims to measure which option (A) Mobile money or (B) e-Dinar (Post money) has a higher impact on the economic empowerment of rural female artisan entrepreneurs.

## Theory of change

*How is your intervention going to fix the market failure? What are the testable implications of results, including null results?*

Our intervention will address the need for an easier to reach transaction economy that does not rely on physical distances to be effective. This revolves around the root issue of uneven access to Places-Of-Payment (POS) stations across the country, although post offices are available to consolidate cash transactions, and the encompassing benefits of a value-currency economy on the chances of micro-financed businesses (disproportionately represented by women-owned businesses).

The high degree of connectivity among mobile phone users allows us to center around the activity part of the intervention, as to create enough e-Dinar or Mobile money users for an active online economy. This is trackable through digital data collection of web activities, which can follow how many cards are used at a time, for what transactions, if they are used consistently throughout time, and if they provide a functional service ([Arango-Arango & Suárez-Ariza, 2020](https://cashessentials.org/app/uploads/2019/08/Arango_etal_digital-pmts-adoption-and-the-demand-for-cash_international-evidence.pdf)).

Upon the evaluation of these immediate outputs, the collective outcome will have to be a rise in the economic survivability of rural businesses, and women based businesses, as well as a relative switch from a cash-based economy to a digital based economy. Micro-financing indicators, and their overall use and withdrawal patterns ([Zekri, 2013](https://search.proquest.com/openview/f43ea8741748aca16be5a5d7cffbd132/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1056382&casa_token=dqhbnhNvWSoAAAAA:0gINDvUVxwhrjx8EjpiqoMyotIKCB6R5MZTevN-ulSSJ--TDfh7ztA9Lw11rGgSqta7rusrKUw)), might reveal whether or not our intervention has worked, with failure being represented by a continued reliance on ATM positioning for cash financing, and a decrease in financing requests from targeted populations (women, small textile producers etc.).

## Relevance

*What will we learn from your intervention beyond its local impact? What are some other situations in which that knowledge can be used?*

Other MENA countries share similar characteristics to Tunisia – namely Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco. In general, their female entrepreneurs are facing the same set of challenges as Tunisia: gender pay gap is considerable, female participation in the workforce is low, and societal prejudice is still deeply entrenched. These factors have resulted in an underdeveloped setting for female-owned businesses including a general aversion to expanding existing companies ([Drine & Grach, 2010](https://idp.springer.com/authorize/casa?redirect_uri=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ejdr.2011.13&casa_token=R7mocWqc5yMAAAAA:zgfAcrOtGCK01mNvib8nArKYbukN2TJep6zWVNrEvxKAoMMY4y1AR2YQ1sc7Vk3hWWG6ERR_R0wBHD8Q)). Just like in Tunisia, the other three countries are beginning to increase workplace protection for female business owners.

For example, all four countries have recently ratified the Equal Remuneration Convention and the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention, which provides an institutional basis for the protection of gender equal rights ([OECD, 2018](https://www.oecd.org/publications/the-mediterranean-middle-east-and-north-africa-2018-9789264304161-en.htm)). Moreover, the countries in question have all initiated national projects in similar fashion to Tunisia’s National Programme for Women’s Entrepreneurship to boost entrepreneurship and to allow better access to financing, aimed at encouraging more females to join the workforce and to create their own businesses ([OECD, 2018](https://www.oecd.org/publications/the-mediterranean-middle-east-and-north-africa-2018-9789264304161-en.htm)). While these measures are still insufficient to fully address the issue of workplace gender equality, they are still receptive to improvements, and would only benefit from the added utility of digital payments.

# Measurement

## Design
*What is the research design? Who are the research subjects? Which are the comparison groups?*

Our intervention will leverage a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) covering from 900 to 1200 female artisan entrepreneurs from the northwest region of Tunisia. Our Control Group will be rural women-led artisan micro enterprises that will keep using (B) e-Dinar (Post money). Our Treatment Group will be composed of rural women-led artisan micro enterprises that will continue to use (B) e-Dinar (Post money) but will also employ Mobile money services. These women entrepreneurs will be contacted through the Cooperative Acea.

## Data
*How will you measure outcomes? How will you collect information? How much information will you collect? From who?*

Our data collection will start by obtaining several baseline figures from female artisan entrepreneurs participating in our intervention, including current sales and x. After three months, our team will collect updated figures for the same variables measured at the baseline. The data collection will happen both in-person and virtually.

## Complications
*What issues and complications do you foresee? What is the timeline? When will you have results?*

Our timeline includes approximately two months to complete the research design process, such as choosing the sample size, meeting ethical requirements, preparing the consent process and data management. This will be followed by one month of training and sharing information with participants to get familiar with the intervention. Then, the implementation part will keep going for three months until we can start seeing the results of our intervention. Finally, we will collect the data and analyze the results to compare outcomes from the baseline to those obtained after the implementation. Given the cost and complexity of RCTS, our biggest complication entails the need for financial and human resources to undertake this study, particularly in a rural setting.
