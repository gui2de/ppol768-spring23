# Spatial Mismatch in the DMV

## Introduction
"Spatial mismatch" refers to the discrepancy between the locations of suitable job opportunities and job seekers’ residences and neighborhoods. Spatial mismatch can create significant challenges for residents belonging to metropolitan areas that consist of sprawling suburbs. A critical example is the case of workers living in economically disadvantaged areas, where they may struggle to locate employment opportunities in those disadvantaged areas that can provide sufficient salaries. Importantly, this difficult reality can generate higher levels of poverty and unemployment, in addition to lower average salaries. As a consequence, affected communities may likely experience higher rates of crime and social isolation or exclusion among affected individuals. At the same time, hiring firms may also suffer as they struggle to hire qualified labor to fill needs. Academic studies in various geographies have found that greater mismatch exacerbates regional unemployment rates and persistent joblessness. The construction and expansion of public transit is one popular approach to mitigate spatial mismatch and improve labor market outcomes.

The delayed construction of the Purple Line (now slated to open in 2026) offers a unique opportunity for a longitudinal study of the impact of a new light-rail line on employment and socioeconomic outcomes in the Washington D.C. area. The Purple Line project includes twenty-one planned stations that will link Maryland suburbs with existing lines that run through downtown Washington D.C. The project is designed to integrate currently disparate residential and labor hubs into the DC metro area.

### Problem statement:
The spatial mismatch hypothesis, popularly attributed to Kain (1968), posits that poor labor market outcomes for poor urban workers are exacerbated by a geographical mismatch between their residences and suitable job opportunities (Brueckner and Zenou 2003). Spatial mismatch comprises multiple geography-related elements, such as limited public-transit options, long commutes, limited affordable housing options near job hubs, and limited access to private transit. These issues contribute to higher regional unemployment rates and longer jobless spells among low-income workers (Andersson et al 2014).

Analyses of spatial mismatches in the Washington D.C. area have demonstrated similar negative impacts on labor market outcomes. One analysis of the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria metropolitan statistical area found that, from 2000 to 2012, the overall number of jobs near the average resident increased by 2 percent; however, in high-poverty and "majority-minority" census tracts, the number of jobs located near the average resident declined by 9.6 percent and 19.1 percent, respectively (Kneebone and Holmes 2015). In the context of Washington D.C., spatial mismatch is often described along an “east-west” division along the Anacostia River, a division also marked by racial and socioeconomic disparities (Chung 2015). 

The Purple Line, expected to open in 2026, will connect Marylanders to WMATA transit in the Washington metropolitan area and will run through Montgomery County, Maryland and Prince George’s County, Maryland. According to the DC Policy Center using data from the IPUMS National Historical GIS Project, Black residents either willingly relocated or were economically displaced to the suburbs in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties over the past 50 years. Today, Prince George’s County is the largest county in the nation with a majority Black resident population.

### Background and motivation:

This proposed analysis of the Purple Line is grounded in previous studies of public transit projects in other geographies. Fan et al. (2012) examined the impact of a new light-rail line in the Minneapolis metropolitan area on access to jobs for high-, medium-, and low-wage workers; they found positive effects on job accessibility for all cohorts. Holzer et al. (2003) leveraged the construction of a new heavy-rail system in the San Francisco Bay Area to conduct a survey of firms; they found increased hiring of residents near new stations. 

While many studies use administrative data to draw conclusions on new metro stations' impacts, our proposed analysis would include both administrative and longitudinal survey data. The primary motivation for conducting surveys is that we can collect unique data points during pre- and post-treatment periods. After-the-fact analysis of administrative data limits possible lines of inquiry. The delayed construction and opening of the Purple Line in 2026 represents a unique opportunity for a natural experiment. Holzer et al.’s (2003) analysis of the new metro line in the San Francisco Bay Area offers a useful model for pre- and post-treatment surveys of firms before and after the opening of a new heavy-rail line to examine their propensity to hire minority workers residing near new stations. A similar analysis of the DC area labor market offers an opportunity to address previous limitations, such as restrictions to arbitrary distance inclusion criteria and the exclusion of jobseekers.

## Intervention
### Market failure:

Spatial mismatch is an issue that labor market studies (and policy practitioners) have yet to resolve. This market failure occurs when there are unequal opportunities for employment based on where an individual resides. In other words, geographical and transportation barriers prevent transactions in the labor market, i.e., the market is not perfectly competitive because qualified applicants and hiring firms cannot transact. Transportation challenges prevent jobseekers from gaining employment in distant employment hubs, and hiring firms may choose to reject applicants from particular geographies. We hypothesize that this market failure is pronounced for poor households and single- and zero-car households for whom a new metro line would enable more hiring opportunities. We choose to examine the market failure among DC’s Black workers as they face above-average unemployment rates in both DC and Maryland. Even when access to public transportation has no effect on the rate at which a company hires minority applications, spatial mismatch implies that companies that want to avoid hiring certain or all minority applicants may choose to establish their firms in publicly inaccessible locations. The intervention (described below) capitalizes on a public-private partnership established by the state of Maryland. 

### Theory of change:

The Purple Line project employs a direct, small-scale intervention: a public-private partnership with the Maryland Department of Transportation and Purple Line Transit Partners, LLC. Through the partnership, the state of Maryland seeks to correct severe traffic congestion in the Beltway (the highway that encircles the District of Columbia) while improving mobility for households who are dependent on public transportation. Current projections estimate that roughly 17,000 daily auto trips will be eliminated while reducing travel times by nearly 40%. Our model tests whether expanding access to public transportation for low-income households who tend to live farther away from job opportunities not only improves efficiency of the overall public transportation system, but also improves socio-economic equity and advancement as well as reduce negative externalities. Testable implications of results include proximity to transit stops on unemployment rates and employment patterns. In the DMV, it is possible that the additional transit stops have no effect on the mobility and thus access to employment opportunities of any group of individuals.

### Relevance:
Beyond understanding the local impact of expanding transit-stops on accessibility to employment opportunities for low-income households and minority households, this project will contribute a deeper contextual analysis within the field of urban planning. It will offer insight into social policies related to community-based job development and accessible, well-developed public transportation systems. Several studies have suggested that investing in and increasing public transportation mobility is the most feasible and efficient short term fix for these issues. What we learn in this project may serve to inform discussions of land use surrounding zoning and housing, which are closely linked to transportation and employment issues as well. 

Hellerstein, Neumark, and McInerney (2007) find that spatial mismatch is particularly an issue for low-skilled, Black male workers. They supplement the existing literature by hypothesizing that the spatial mismatch may not be simply that there is an absence of “good jobs” where Black laborers reside, but rather that there remains a lack of jobs hiring Black people, even in the neighborhoods in which Black workers reside. This harmful phenomenon may occur, according to the authors, perhaps due to discrimination, labor market networks, or “neighborhood effects in which race matters.” The economists find that race does indeed play a key role. Furthermore, the study finds that simply close proximity of local jobs for Black residents “is not enough to markedly impact Black employment rates.”


# Experimental Design
Below we outline the parameters of the proposed experiment. Our proposal involves collecting data regarding the employment rate of Black workers in the DMV area, in order to compare changes in employment rates across treatment and control groups. The treatment and control groups of this research design are defined below. In short, we are interested in determining whether the change in the employment rate for Black Maryland workers before and after completion of the Purple metro line is different compared to the change in the employment rate for Black D.C. workers in the same duration. Leveraging the 2003 Holzer et al. study on spatial mismatch in the “Bay Area” of Oakland, California, we will follow in the footsteps of the economists who have built the foundation of the spatial mismatch scholarship; we will replicate their research design by similarly collecting data on firms’ hiring practices. More specifically, we intend to inquire firms in the DMV area on the racial characteristics of those firms’ most recently hired employees. 

### Interventions studied
A similar study published in 1999 examined spatial mismatch for male youth employment by race in the Washington, DC area (Stoll). The results suggested that the employment outcomes in the two suburban treatment groups (Montgomery-DC and Prince George’s-DC areas) were worse for young Black males than the central city control group (DC proper). More importantly, the results provided evidence that young White males may have better employment outcomes than young Black males in both suburban treatment groups. However, this difference may be attributed to the fact that there is a greater concentration of White residents in both the treatment groups, which may explain part of why White employment rates tend to be higher than their counterparts.


## Measurement
We propose a difference-in-difference model that refines and builds upon the Holzer et al. study of new metro lines in the Bay Area. We prefer this model type for our study, because we identified a policy that will be enacted, and we would like to design a study that can measure the potential causal effect of the intervention (public transit expansion) on employment rates over time. In addition, we prefer the difference-in-difference model, since a randomized control trial is not doable, nor would it be ethical in this case of measuring hiring practices. The intervention in this case is occuring somewhat “naturally,” making the DD model the reasonable econometric choice. 

Per the parallel trends assumption, the null hypothesis would be that the change in the employment rate for the treatment group would be exactly the same as the change in the employment rate for the control group. The alternative hypothesis would be that the change in employment rate for the treatment group, both before and after the public transit expansion, would not be the same as the change in the employment rate for the control group over the same duration.

It is additionally imperative to define the two groups: the treatment group will consist of Black workers in Maryland, as they comprise the population that will receive the intervention/treatment of a metro line expansion. The control group would thus consist of Black D.C. workers, because they are not receiving the intervention. We must assume stable, comparable trends between these two types of workers (treatment and control) that would have persisted if the intervention had not been implemented. To be clear, our model will compare the change in employment rate for Maryland workers before and after the Purple line is expanded to the change in the employment rate for D.C. workers over the same period. The overall change in employment rates for D.C. workers subtracted from the overall change in employment rates for Maryland workers will be our difference estimate. 


### Survey data collection and processing
We would conduct a longitudinal two-wave survey of firms in the Maryland suburbs surrounding planned Purple Line metro stations. We would additionally identify three employer size categories, including small, medium, and large firms and organizations. The first-wave survey would have been conducted in the two weeks prior to completion of the Purple Line extension project. The second-wave survey of firms would be conducted approximately one year following the project completion. The research design additionally relies upon survey interviews (conducted ideally via email) with a hiring individual or manager with each establishment identified. The main information collected during the two-wave surveys would ideally be focused on the race of the most recent hires with each interviewed firm in order to obtain information regarding employment rate changes based on race. The difference estimate (as described above) would be ideally calculated in Stata.

In addition to survey data, we would access recent Public-Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data to examine variables related to commuting, employment, residence, car-ownership, and measures of socioeconomic well-being, both before and after the construction of the Purple Line.


### Complications:
Employer response rates to surveys inquiring about hiring practices and outcomes may likely be very low, even if the surveys were to be conducted via email, rather than telephone or in-person surveys. Nonresponse bias may present a challenge if there are systematic differences between responding and non-responding populations. Employers may likely not want to report information regarding their recent hire’s racial demographics for various reasons, including privacy or confidentiality concerns. In addition, firms may be concerned that they may appear biased or discriminatory in their hiring practices depending on their hiring practices, which they may fear could affect that organization’s reputation and future economic prospects. Not only could reputational risk non-randomly affect response rates but it could also motivate respondents to give inaccurate data (social desirability bias).

This study’s main objective is collecting information from each interviewed hiring manager of the organization's most recent hire. An additional complication could be another case of selection bias. For example, suppose only more progressive firms or hiring managers are willing to discuss their hiring practices and thus may be more likely to answer the emails compared to firms with sketchier hiring practices. If the only firms that respond to the survey are ones that have recently hired Black Maryland laborers, then the results may look like the Purple Line construction project was more beneficial than it actually is.

Our hypothesized causal model certainly runs a risk of endogeneity. One example may lie in the fact that Black Maryland workers who live remotely may have a harder time locating jobs due to their disconnectedness. It also may likely be the case that unemployed workers may move to more remote locations, as those more remote locations may be relatively more affordable places to live, compared to areas in which there are many job opportunities. 

An additional, important consideration is that of “spillovers.” An economic event may occur prior to the completion of the Purple Line construction project. Suppose this event affects employment of workers in the DMV area. If this is the case, then the effect of the public transit expansion on employment rates of the treatment group compared to the control group may be murky or unclear. The expansion may appear either more beneficial or perhaps less helpful to improving employment opportunities than it really is. 

Many of the studies described above cannot guarantee external validity. We anticipate that this may likely be the case, as well, for our spatial mismatch research; however, we would hope that our future research on spatial mismatch in the DMV would attain internal validity. That is, we would like to see that our results capture an understanding of what it is exactly that we would like to study- how employment rates for Black Maryland workers may be affected by the construction of the Purple Line metro expansion compared to the change in employment rates for Black District workers. 

Finally, another possible complication we anticipate may be that of statistical significance. If we are unable to identify a relatively large number of firms willing to provide information regarding their most recent hire’s demographic information, then we run the risk of having a very small sample size. A small “n” could threaten the statistical significance of our model. While statistical significance is not the top priority of this research proposal, we hope to collect solid data that could potentially capture meaningful results to expand the existing scholarship on spatial mismatch.
