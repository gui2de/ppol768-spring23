# Pitch
## Scott Brown, Hannah Hill, Peyton Weber


Your project pitch should be 2-5 pages long, and respond to the following questions :
## Introduction


### Problem statement: 
What is the issue? The issue cannot be "people are poor" or "resources are insufficient".
- population decreasing, vacancies increasing
- lack of affordable housing

### Background and motivation: 
Why should we care? What are the research and knowledge implications of trying to solve this problem?
- history of educational segregation and redlining
- educational funds tied to property rich districts --> white flight


## Intervention
### Market failure: 
What mechanism is your intervention trying to use to improve the situation? As above, it cannot be "relaxing resource constraints" -- there must be an economic possibility as to why existing resources are being used inefficiently.
- local and state funds make up 90% of education funding which is based on property rich districts --> local approach, not federal
- mechanism: 


### Theory of change:
How is your intervention going to fix the market failure? What are the testable implications of results, including null results?


### Relevance: 
What will we learn from your intervention beyond its local impact? What are some other situations in which that knowledge can be used?


## Measurement
### Design:
The research design will rely upon a difference-in-differences model. We prefer this model type for our study, because we identified a policy that was enacted, and we would like to design a study that would be able to measure the impact of that policy over time. We are able to utilize a difference-in-differences model, because can reasonably assume that trends in employer hiring practices in the DMV area would be similar both before and after extension of the silver metro line into the suburbs of northern Virginia. The treatment groups (including pre and post policy implementation) will comprise of firms having recently hired Black employees both before and after the silver line extension project was completed. The control groups will consist of firms having recently hired non-Black employees both before and after the silver line extension project was completed. The overall change in the comparison group (non-Black workers being hired before and after policy implementation) subtracted from the change in the target group (hired Black workers before and after silver line extension) will be our difference estimate. 


### Data:
We would conduct two-wave surveys of firms in the northern Virginia area surrounding the newly extended silver line metro stations. We would additionally identify three employer size categories, including small, medium, and large firms and organizations. The first-wave survey would have been conducteed in the two weeks prior to completion of the silver line extension project. The second-wave survey of firms would be conducted approximately one year following the project completion. The research design additionally relies upon survey interviews (conducted ideally via email) with a hiring individual or manager with each establishment identified. The main information collected during the two-wave surveys would ideally be focused on the race of the more recent hires with each interviewed firm. 


### Complications:
Employer response rates to surveys inquiring about hiring practices and outcomes may likely be very low, even if the surveys were to be conducted via email, rather than telephone or in-person surveys. The main objective would to be to focus on collecting information from each interviewed hiring manager of the organization's most recent hire. Perhaps a more egregious complication would be that we are unable to invent a time machine and interview firms prior to the completion of the silver line metro expansion project. If data already exists on the race of the more recent hires with firms near the silver line stations prior to the extension, we could perhaps rely upon this data. Another possible solution might be that we could inquire the hiring managers of each interviewed organization to review their hiring histories and ask them to report the racial makeup of the recently-hired employees approximately two weeks before the silver line extension end date.
