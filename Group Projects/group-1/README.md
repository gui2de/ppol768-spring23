# Pitch
## Scott Brown, Hannah Hill, Peyton Weber


Your project pitch should be 2-5 pages long, and respond to the following questions :
## Introduction


### Problem statement: 
What is the issue? The issue cannot be "people are poor" or "resources are insufficient".

### Background and motivation: 
Why should we care? What are the research and knowledge implications of trying to solve this problem?


## Intervention
### Market failure: 
What mechanism is your intervention trying to use to improve the situation? As above, it cannot be "relaxing resource constraints" -- there must be an economic possibility as to why existing resources are being used inefficiently.


### Theory of change:
How is your intervention going to fix the market failure? What are the testable implications of results, including null results?


### Relevance: 
What will we learn from your intervention beyond its local impact? What are some other situations in which that knowledge can be used?


## Measurement
### Design:
What is the research design? Who are the research subjects? Which are the comparison groups?


### Data:
How will you measure outcomes? How will you collect information? How much information will you collect? From who?


### Complications:
What issues and complications do you foresee? What is the timeline? When will you have results?
