# Research Proposal

## Introduction
In this research project, we are going to focus on one of China's most important ongoing economic reform - the "mixed-ownership" reform to State-owned enterprises (SOEs) and its aggregate impact on their performances. In 2015, China released series of policy plans that aim to reform the SOEs, introducing the idea of "mixed ownership" to the companies' financial compositions. According to the Chinese president Xi Jinping, the reform was expected to "promote strengthening, improvement, and expansion of state capital, effectively prevent [the] loss of state assets, deepen the reform of [SOEs], develop a mixed-ownership economy, and cultivate globally competitive world-class firms." (CNBC, 2017) Although the state acknowledged that SOEs should be more marketized and free up market spaces to encourage competition, it remained hesitant to make radical changes out of political reasons. Still, the latest round of SOE reform was given great expectations as it had the potential to demonstrate how the Communist Party will maintain the balance between commercial interests and political will.

### Problem Statement
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) contribute to around 30% of China's economy and are viewed to be the most powerful yet mysterious powerhouses in its economic miracle over recent decades. In its self-transformation from a planned economy dominated by SOEs to a vibrant global market where the private sector plays the lead, China also faces great challenges as it painstakingly maintain a balance between developing market economy while keeping its inefficient SOEs in key strategic positions.  Previous reform has resulted in the emergence of giant national SOE companies, which accumulate huge number of resources through either merging with or acquiring other companies, thereby outcompeting smaller peers or operating in a more efficient and profit-seeking manner. While these cases provide concrete precedents of successful SOE reforms, other central and local SOEs increasingly suffer from lack of resources and business incentives. This drawback creates a crucial threat to the Chinese economy: while its ongoing economic reform improves market conditions, these SOEs often remain relatively closed to the global economy, or sometimes even domestic investors. More importantly, state capital tends to be most concentrated in industries that are considered to be the 'lifeblood' of the national economy (China Briefing, 2019). As economic growth slows, structural reforms to the SOEs have become the most pressing issue for the Chinese Communist Party to alleviate severe market inefficiencies and unleash some new growth opportunities.

## Interventions

### Market Failure
In response to the aforementioned economic challenges, China released series of policy plans that aim to reform the SOEs, introducing the idea of "mixed ownership" to the companies' financial compositions. Previously, the government had promoted other reforms, which include supply-side restructuring to curtail excess capacity, but the mixed-ownership reform was the first in years to directly touch the base of company performances in the long-term. Under new regulations, private investors would be given opportunities to hold SOE stakes, buy SOE-issued convertible bonds, or swap shares between the two parties. 

### Theory of Change
First, ownership reform is an important means to integrate the advantages of state-owned capital and private capital. From the perspective of long-term development, the comprehensive integration and utilization of current resources by enterprises represent the potential for future development of enterprises. It is difficult to achieve the strategic goal of becoming bigger, better, and stronger if relying on the company's own development. Secondly, the mixed ownership reform of state-owned enterprises is an effective path to introduce social capital and enlarge the function of state-owned capital. Through the reform of the mixed ownership of state-owned enterprises, the cooperation between state-owned capital and non-state-owned capital can be realized, the positioning of state-owned enterprises in the capital market will be clearer, and state-owned capital will play a leading and guiding role in the capital market. Healthy development injects new vitality. In addition, another impetus for the reform of mixed ownership of state-owned enterprises is to improve the distribution of rights in state-owned enterprises and other issues. It can change the dominance of one company, allow more shareholders to participate in decision-making, and enable shareholders to supervise and restrict each other. It can also reduce the company's management costs and improve the company's internal supervision system.

### Relevance
In addition to judging the effect of this ownership reform in China, the conclusions of this study can also reveal to a certain extent the sensitivity of different industries and enterprises of different natures to the ownership reform. Through cluster analysis or some visualization, we can try to discover the relationship and change trend between short-term benefits and long-term benefits of different industries and ownership reforms. The research conclusions of China's ownership reform can be used as a reference for all economies that use a planned economy or state-owned enterprises to account for the main body of the economy. The industry characteristics and changing trends can be specifically applied to the economic transformation of those industries and the reconstruction of the organizational framework. For example, to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality, the governments of various countries need to redirect the development of their own heavy industry enterprises, and the effect of this part of the ownership reform (the effect of the free market guidance) can be regarded as an early reference.

## Measurements

### Design
This study analyzes the effects of China's 2013 SOE/ownership reforms. Our research plans to use Difference in Difference (DID) to conduct research. The basic idea is to construct a double difference statistic reflecting the effect of the policy by comparing the difference between the control group and the treatment group before and after the implementation of the policy. In the study, those enterprises whose state ownership in total top 10 ownership shifts from above 50% to below 50% are regarded as the treatment group, and the rest are regarded as the control group. The absolute cumulative abnormal return of each enterprise in units of years will be selected as the dependent variable as the standard to measure the actual effect of the reform, for a cumulative abnormal return is the total of all abnormal returns and can be used to measure the effect lawsuits, buyouts, and other events have on stock prices. Some other stock market indicators will be added to the model as control variables, including firm size, book-to-market ratio, debt-to-asset ratio, loss indicator, and sales growth. After performing correlation regression analysis using Stata and doing tests and adjustments such as dealing with heteroscedasticity and multicollinearity, we also plan to use a placebo to test the robustness of the model.

### Data
The data of this research comes from the CSMAR database, which contains the stock data of all companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. It is worth noting that ACAR is not data that can be queried directly. We need to find relevant data and use the least square method to calculate the annual ACAR and use it as the dependent variable of the research. All collected data (all required variables in the model) will form panel data spanning from 2004 to 2022. The data range includes all companies successfully listed on the two major stock exchanges, which will ensure that we have a large enough sample set to support our final conclusions. Since the DID model is used, we only need to pay attention to the coefficient of the interaction term in the model to get the desired net effect of the policy under the DID model. 

### Complications
There are several potential problems in this research: The first is the complexity of data processing. The huge amount of data determines that we need to process the data of different time periods in parts and then merge them. At the same time, the speed of data processing will also encounter great challenges. In addition, some variable data that cannot be directly obtained need to be manually determined by external tools (Excel VBA, etc.), such as the screening of the treatment group and control group. We need to pay attention to avoid making mistakes in these steps and resulting in deviations in the results. The second is the analysis of regression results. It is difficult for us to improve the external validity of the results because of the large sample size. Perhaps cluster analysis would be a good solution, but this requires further judgment and thinking. We plan to complete the data collection, preprocessing and initial establishment of the model in February. In March, we conducted the literature review, and regression analysis, completed related tests, obtained preliminary results, and actively adjusted the model. In April we determine our final model (maybe multiple models at different levels) and give a first draft of our research results. After receiving feedback in May, we will complete the final draft and explain our research results through presentations.
