# Week 02

This week's assignments (due 01/30) repeats last week's assignment using the GitHub branching, PR, and merging tools:

## Assignment 1: Add your biography to the class repository and extend it using Markdown formatting features

- Clone the `ppol768-spring23` repository from GitHub to your local machine using GitKraken.
- Create and check out a branch for this week's asssignments called `w01-initials` (replace "initials" by your initials) using GitKraken.
- Navigate in your file browser (ie, Finder) to the repository, and open the folder with your name inside the "Individual Assignments" directory.
- Create a `week-02` folder inside your folder in the "Individual Assignments" directory.
- In your `week-02` folder, create a `README.md` file. In it, copy over your two-paragraph biography of yourself, including your program, your level of experience with Stata, GitHub, and SurveyCTO, and some other basic biographical information of your choice. Save your edits. We recommend you use a text editing software like [VSCode](https://gdeiana.github.io/economics/stata-vscode/) to do this.
- Next, create an `img` folder in the same directory. Put a profile picture of yourself in that directory.
- Add the profile picture of yourself to the biography using the relative file path, according to [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
- Add a few more paragraphs about your research interests -- specifically, add at least one table, at least one list, at least one hyperlink, at least one subsection header. Try out some of the other Markdown formatting. You will continue using these tools as you submit your group project materials. For example, try inserting some [math](https://github.blog/2022-05-19-math-support-in-markdown/).

## Assignment 2: Push your branch to GitHub and merge it into `main` using the pull request and review process

- Push your branch to the GitHub remote using GitKraken, and then open a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch using the online GitHub interface. Assign someone at random from the group to review your request by tagging the class group (@ppol768-spring23) under the Reviewers' box on the right.
- When you are assigned to someone else's request, experiment with leaving comments and suggestions in the Review feature in the online interface. Leave some comments, including asking for additional information.
- When you receive comments from someone else, make a few changes to experiment with this feature. Then, approve and merge the PR to `main` using the online interface.
- NOTE: this is the only weekly assignment for which making changes after receiving a review is specifically required. This is because this week's assignment is all about learning and experiment with GitHub and Pull Requests.
- Delete your working branch locally and online after merging the PR.
