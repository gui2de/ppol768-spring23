# GitKraken instructions

- Download and install the [GitKraken Client](https://www.gitkraken.com/) on your own laptop. If you want the Pro version (you will not need it for this class, but might as well get it; it will allow you in particular to sync private repos), you can get it for free as a student [at this link](https://www.gitkraken.com/github-student-developer-pack-bundle). You should be able to log into gitkraken with your github account credentials.  
- Alternatively, you can install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your machine and use whatever client you like for it (command line, GitBash, Github Desktop, etc), but the course will be taught with GitKraken and we can't guarantee troubleshooting errors with other tools!  
- We also recommend installing a syntax-highlighting [text editor](https://kinsta.com/blog/best-text-editors/) like Atom, Sublime, Notepad++, etc. Atom has some nice collaborating features that makes it our #1 rec, but we are open minded :-).
