# Week 03

This week's (due 02/06) assignments are:

## Assignment 1 : Form a group

- Follow instructions on [Group Projects](https://github.com/gui2de/ppol768-spring23/blob/aaa8986faf01321d0969bdbe404d887c68a0e95d/Group%20Projects/README.md) to form a group and notify us via the class repository.

## Assignment 2 : Submit a project pitch for your group project.

- Create a subfolder called `group-X` under the `Group Projects` folder (replacing X by the number of your group)
- Create an README.md at the root of that folder, where you will write out a pitch for your group project. The pitch will present your topic and your approach for studying it.
- In order to help you think of examples of topics, we have uploaded under the `examples` subfolder some inspiration for the final deliverable you will be producing as a group for this class : in between a pre-analysis plan and a research project presentation. The group project assignments consist of several cumulative milestones (pitch, concept note, tables, final presentation) that will slowly build up to that final product. 
- For this first submission, we do not expect that you will use any real data or do an in-depth literature review, but you should be able to find basic information about your topic online and be able to put together a simple summary of the state of knowledge in the area.
- Your project pitch should be 2-5 pages long, and respond to the following questions :
1. Introduction    
   - Problem statement : what is the issue?    
   - Background and motivation : why should we care?    
1. Intervention
   - Market failure : what particular mechanism is your intervention trying to fix?
   - Theory of change : why is your intervention going to fix it?
   - Relevance : what will we learn from your intervention beyond its own impact?
1. Measurement
   - Design : what is the research design?
   - Data : how will you measure outcomes?
   - Complications : what issues and complications do you foresee?
