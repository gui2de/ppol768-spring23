# Week 01

This week's (due 01/23) assignments are:

## Assignment 1a : Write Biography and Upload to Your Own GitHub Repo

- Install GitKraken if you don't already have a Git client (instructions [here](https://github.com/gui2de/ppol768-spring23/tree/main/Class%20Materials))
- Create and clone your own public repo following instructions from this week's [slides](01b_intro_git.pdf)
- Create a README.md in your own repo and write a two-paragraph biography of yourself, including your program, your level of experience with Stata, GitHub, and SurveyCTO, and some other basic biographical information of your choice. Save your edits. We recommend you use a text editing software like Atom to do this.
- Add a link to your own repo in your Goals Essay

## Assignment 1b: Merge Biography on GitHub Class Repo _(will be done in lab on Thursday 01/26)_

- Clone the `ppol768-spring23` repository from GitHub to your local machine using GitKraken.
- Create and check out a branch for this week's asssignments called `w01-initials` (replace "initials" by your initials) using GitKraken.
- Navigate in your file browser (ie, Finder) to the repository, and open the folder with your name inside the "Individual Assignments" directory.
- Create a `week-01` folder inside your folder in the "Individual Assignments" directory.
- In your `week-01` folder, create a `README.md` file. 
- In that same folder, upload your CITI certificate.
- Push your branch to the GitHub remote using GitKraken, and then open a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch using the online GitHub interface. Assign someone at random from the group to review your request by tagging the class group (@ppol768-spring23) under the Reviewers' box on the right.
- When you are assigned to someone else's request, experiment with leaving comments and suggestions in the Review feature in the online interface. Leave some comments, including asking for additional information.
- When you receive comments from someone else, make a few changes to experiment with this feature. Then, approve and merge the PR to `main` using the online interface.
- NOTE: this is the only weekly assignment for which making changes after receiving a review is specifically required. This is because this week's assignment is all about learning and experiment with GitHub and Pull Requests.
- Delete your working branch locally and online after merging the PR.

## Assignment 2: Reflection and Goals Essay

- This is a more open ended assignment and will not be visible to your peers. Here, we want you to write a short (2-3pg) essay reflecting on the nature of research and outlining your current experience and your learning goals for the course.
- You are encouraged to reference the class readings (required and suggested) from the first couple of weeks to feed into the content of your essay. You should reflect on what is social science research, what makes it interesting, hard or easy, and what are your personal goals related to it.
- To write your goals, you can use [the SMART framework that Georgetown uses](https://georgetown.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/GU-FY22-Performance-Management-Terms-and-Tools.pdf) for its employees self evaluations, which recommends goals to be : Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound.
- You will return to this essay when you write your midterm and final self-evaluations about your learning and success in the course. For your reference, the self-assessment template is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tWC3z3pbHoNAn_octc_Edj3W4f7DinQd6sLhLbjo-Lw/edit?usp=sharing).
- Please write this in Word with standard settings (Calibri 12pt). Include your name at the top and include page numbers in the bottom margin. Save it in your personal files -- do NOT save it in the class repository!
- Name the file `INITIALS_W01-GOALS.docx` (replacing INITIALS with your initials). Use capital letters and the underscore and dash -- not spaces -- so the title is exactly as appears here. This is important so the files alphabetize and order correctly in our system.
- Add a link to your own repo created in Asssignemnt 1a
- Submit this assignment using the Box submission link: [SUBMIT](https://georgetown.app.box.com/f/e8b46836b7304c81b1461c8756615f8f). This link will remain the submission link for the private evaluations throughout the term, and we'll let you know when to use it.
