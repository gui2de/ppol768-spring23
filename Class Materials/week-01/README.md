# Week 01

This week's assignments are:

## Assignment 1: Create Biography and Merge on GitHub

- Clone the `ppol768-spring23` repository from GitHub to your local machine using GitKraken.
- Create and check out a branch for this week's asssignments called `w1-initials` (replace "initials" by your initials) using GitKraken.
- Navigate in your file browser (ie, Finder) to the repository, and open the folder with your name inside the "Individual Assignments" directory.
- Create a `week-01` folder inside your folder in the "Individual Assignments" directory.
- In your `week-01` folder, create a `README.md` file. In it, write a two-paragraph biography of yourself, including your program, your level of experience with Stata, GitHub, and SurveyCTO, and some other basic biographical information of your choice. Save your edits. We recommend you use a text editing software like Atom to do this.
- Push your branch to the GitHub remote using GitKraken, and then open a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch using the online interface. Assign someone at random from the group to review your request.
- When you are assigned to someone else's request, experiment with leaving comments and suggestions in the Review feature in the online interface. Leave some comments.
- When you recieve comments from someone else, make a few changes to experiment with this feature. Then, approve and merge the PR to `main` using the online interface.
- Delete your working branch locally and online after merging the PR.

## Assignment 2: Reflection and Goals Essay

- This is a more open ended assignment and will not be visible to your peers. Here, we want you to write a short (2-3pg) essay reflecting on the nature of research and outlining your current experience and your learning goals for the course.
- You will return to this essay when you write your midterm and final self-evaluations about your learning and success in the course.
- Please write this in Word with standard settings (Calibri 12pt). Include your name at the top and include page numbers in the bottom margin. Save it in your personal files -- do NOT save it in the class repository!
- Name the file `INITIALS_W01-GOALS.docx` (replacing INITIALS with your initials). Use capital letters and the underscore and dash -- not spaces -- so the title is exactly as appears here. This is important so the files alphabetize and order correctly in our system.
- Submit this assignment using the Box submission link: [SUBMIT](https://georgetown.app.box.com/f/e8b46836b7304c81b1461c8756615f8f). This link will remain the submission link for the private evaluations throughout the term, and we'll let you know when to use it.
